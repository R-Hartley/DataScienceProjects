      "British Airways from Tampa to Gatwick on Boeing 777 Club World. Having travelled out WT Plus to Miami we got a good deal coming back from Tampa so flew Club Class. Checked in at Tampa with no queues, and used the International Lounge at Tampa. Supposed to be exclusive to BA customers this had comfortable seats, and good choice of newspapers and magazines. Did not try WiFi. However, there was disappointingly very poor choice of snacks - a few dried up sorry looking sandwiches which were not replenished during my time there, and crackers with some processed cheese with a few dips, some wine, beer, liquor and soft drinks. Pretty uninspiring stuff. On board comfortable, if narrow, seats that extended into (more or less) flat beds. British Airways still have the very camped 2-4-2 layout with fellow passengers having to clamber over people to go to the rest room etc. Reasonable meal (beef) accompanied by an outstanding Chablis Premier Cru and a very nice Sauvignon Blanc. My wife slept for 5 straight hours - I could only sleep fitfully as not much room at shoulder level but at least the seats were comfortable. Terrible selection of films on the entertainment system. Took off on time, and landed slightly early. FA's quite smiley and nice.: 2 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Miami on one of British Airways crummy Boeing 747s. Originally Booked WT Plus choosing flight in an A380 with shiny new updated cabin and entertainment system for 3rd year in a row, and for the 3rd year in a row they promptly changed the plane on my flight for a very elderly and not updated Boeing 747. Do BA actually have any A380's? Reasonably comfortable, but the old on demand entertainment system had a poor choice of films and programs. Cabin staff and food okay from memory but, as usual with British Airways nowadays, very small portions. Took off slightly late in fog, made up time on flight and landed slightly early at Miami. Old aircraft notwithstanding I still think WT Plus is well worth the extra - 7 inches of extra legroom is so much more comfortable than coach.: 2 occurrences\n",
      "Check in was prompt but the fight was delayed 2 hours due to unexpected windshield wiper replacements. British Airways cabin crew was not the friendliest or most professional. I have never felt attendants to be so indifferent and self absorbed. I was never asked what I wanted to order. I was simply brought what they chose. I asked for sparkling water and was informed they had \"run out\". I asked for more bread, and was informed they has \"run out\". Dessert was down to one selection. In all, the service was lacking at best. The food was mediocre, and the selection was sub-par. The seats were comfortable and the pod seating was quite good. Flight entertainment is reminiscant of American Airlines from the 1990's, very very disappointing. The most disturbing was the three seatbelt checks all while my belt was visibly around the sleeping blanket. The ammenity kits are of economy class standard on most other airlines. Lavs were not kept clean. I can honestly say I will never fly British Airways again. This was a waste of a $5,000.00.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "San Francisco to Edinburgh via London with British Airways. Upon arrival at Edinburgh Airport we waited over an hour before we were informed, only after seeking out the information ourselves as opposed to an announcement of any kind being made, that our luggage was lost at Heathrow - along with 500 other bags. Things happen, and can be forgiven; it's what happened after the fact that is so completely appalling. We were not given any vouchers or helped in any way by the baggage claim people or by the customer service desk. We were told that our bags would be delivered to us in 24 hours. Since we going to be in a different place every night as we traveled through Scotland, we gave them the address of the B&B where we would be the following night, essentially giving them more than the 24 hours to get our bags to us. We received a text saying that the bags were out for delivery. They did not arrive. In the next seven days, I spent an average of 2.5 hours a day on the phone with the call center in India who were absolutely no help at all. The customer service phone line at BA was not being answered, and the supposed courier service phones lines (2 of them) were gone out of service as well. I emailed both the courier service and BA customer service and did not receive a response from either one. Still, the courier website listed our luggage as being out for delivery. On the evening of the fifth day, it took 45 minutes to get a supervisor on the line (in India) who took another hour to tell me that the baggage claim area in Edinburgh was closed and there was nothing she could do. The bags were continually listed as being out for delivery, but they never showed up. We were never contacted, and neither was the B&B where we had had them (supposedly) sent. On the morning of the sixth day, on yet another call to India, I stated that the extra medicines my friend had brought with her on the plane had run out and that I was going to have to consider taking her to the hospital. Then, in a few hours we received a call from a nice chap at the Edinburgh baggage claim who said he had both bags right there, that they had never been out for delivery at all. We would be in Tarbert on Harris the next night and he had them flown out to us. Seven days after our arrival in Edinburgh. During the seven days, we had to purchase clothes to wear. We missed doing some of the things we had planned to do because of the time spent on the phone with BA and the time spent shopping for clothes. When we made the return flight, we had to pay for an extra checked bag to accommodate the clothing we had purchased. Finally, a month later, we have received a note of intended compensation from British Airways - for the amount of the clothing only. Not anything for the extra bag that we checked that contained clothes that we shouldn't have needed to buy or to check through, and only needed to do so due to the incompetence of British Airways. That's completely on them, and we should be reimbursed for the charges. One would think that there would be some offer of a voucher towards future travel if not monetary compensation for time and inconvenience, but nothing was offered.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This British Airways trip was one of the worst experiences I have had. The Business Class seating was terrible, requiring literally stepping over (and sometimes on) my fellow passengers. Additionally, I was facing backwards while flying. The service was poor, food barely edible, the lounge lacking in nearly every way from dirty tables, torn furniture and lack of power outlets. I suggest doing everything you can to avoid this airline. Their competitors exceed them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from London to Rome, almost perfect on my last 3 flights. Food was edible, the flight attendant very pleasant. The problem with them is their policy to make people pay to choose their seats, very Ryanair.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Stockholm flight was delayed a little leaving Heathrow due to the typical congestion. Club Europe on British Airways 767 does not have the new seats, but comfortable for the two hour flight. Food was okay at best. The Heathrow Galleries lounge has little in the way of food selection. Drinks on board plentiful, FA's good. I feel British Airways are lacking behind their competitors.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Originally booked with Easyjet, Manchester to Moscow and they cancelled my return flight without offering re-routing. Then re-booked with Brussels Airline and they had problems at Brussels with runway repairs but to their credit rebooked me with BA. Finally got my flight sorted with British Airways, comfortable, good food, great choice of films. They lost half a point because I went to the BA information desk at Moscow Airport and asked 'Do you speak English?' to a lady in BA uniform confidently expecting the answer \"of course\". I got a shake of the head and a finger pointed towards a colleague already engaged with another customer.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Don't fly with British Airways, unless you don't have baggage or don't care about it. We took a connection flight via London LHR to San Diego and all our baggage (and of many other passengers in this flight), was delayed for two days. Other flyers told us this problem is frequent with BA. When our baggage finally arrived, one of the suitcases was damaged beyond repair. We filed a complaint, but so far (more than a month) heard nothing from them albeit several calls. Disgraceful attitude. As a final accord, on the return flight, we could not check online, for some unclear reason, while other passengers could. So my wife and I got separate middle seats. Nice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-AMS-LHR checked in online which is quick and simple bag drop at T5 very quick, was able to use the lounge through my FFS which I like. Boarding on to a full flight quick and seats on an exit row comfy with lots of room for 1hr flight, aircraft clean and tidy a drink served, arrived on time and bags off pretty quick. Checked in on line for the return bag drop quick as was security, the gate D28 is a long walk from security. Used the BA lounge which while small is nice although not many food option.. Boarding for A321 took a while but departed on time and once on board the aircraft appeared new. Crew served a drink on the 50 minute flight arrived on time bags out quickly. All in all a decent service for a short flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A superb flight and a very high standard of service. The Dreamliner aircraft was very clean. The seats were perfectly comfortable. The staff were smart and professional at all times. The steward offered to hang my jacket and we were offered drinks and snacks throughout the flight. The quality of the Indian (Tamil) food was second to none and authentic. The captain gave clear and friendly announcements. Overall I felt proud to fly British Airways to India. To me, the airline is a cut above the rest.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR to Venice was on time, friendly cheerful crew and a very enjoyable plate of cold cuts, cheeses, warm rolls and fruit for breakfast, way better than any other breakfast I've had on a BA flight long or short haul. Seats comfortable, very enjoyable flight. The return leg, Barcelona to LHR had the same meal so was very happy plus a glass of wine as it was lunchtime. The standby crew member (who happened to be a purser) in business class was chatty, friendly and pleasant to everyone. He did his best to make up for his colleagues major shortcomings! The original designated purser for the flight on the other hand was well .. he plonked the meal down in front of you without uttering one word. The only words he spoke to the entire 24 passengers in the club section were 'do you want it or not'. He put the roll basket in front of everyone's nose but still did not utter one word. It was bizarre - I've never on any airline experienced such rudeness and disdain for passengers whatever class they were flying! He couldn't even be polite to his colleague with just a 'pass me some cokes' and that was that. Overall we had a very good flying experience with BA but I wont forget that purser and his attitude for a long time!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I who are 76 and 77 respectively arrived at terminal 5 in Jan 2015 to travel to Johannesburg.This was our first experience of the size of this terminal and assumed that this was where we were to eventualy board our flight. However after sitting around for many hours it occured to us that we had picked up any information regarding the flight,so we went to the BA desk only to be informed that the flight had left,and that we had been waiting in the wrong part of terminal five, and if we had been in the right area we would have heard them paging us. Whilst I take full resposibilty not checking the flight boards properly I would like to complain about the way we were treated from that point on, it was now 11 pm on a cold Jan night, my wife and I were escorted to the exit and left to find shelter for the night in an area that we were totally lost in, until we returned for a different flight the next day.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The 747 is definitely showing it's age. Nonetheless it was comfortable. Pre take off drinks offered included water, OJ or sparkling wine. BA also gives the option of pre-ordering your choice of main course online so although I did notice they ran out of choice towards the end of the service I had received my beef. I advise anyone in First/Business/World Traveller Plus to use this facility. World traveller Plus is definitely an 'enhanced economy' versus some airlines premium economy which is more a 'business minus'. So keep expectations in check. You get a bigger seat, pre take off drink, little amenity kit and a slightly upgraded meal. However, considering that I paid only £170 per sector on top of the usual World Traveller (economy) fare it was worth every penny in my eye. Would I pay a crazy supplement for this class of travel? No. But if the surcharge is minimal I'd highly recommend it.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My daughter was booked on a flight from Antigua to St. Kitts on September 5, 2015. (flight BA2157) The flight left nearly 10 minutes early stranding 30 passengers who had just managed to get through customs. I have no idea how a flight can leave early or how you can leave without 30 passengers. The attendant at the desk merely informed these passengers that the desk was closed and they should return tomorrow. It was 3.00 on a Saturday afternoon. Nothing was offered to help these passengers get to their final destination. After calling multiple times and sending various emails, I was \"granted\" a refund. My full refund offer came with a $50 cancellation fee and a $40 service fee. I have yet to accept the offer. We never cancelled her flight nor received anything that looks like service. Do not fly this airline. They are inept and have no idea what customer service is. There is no 'value for money' when the flight departs early.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I recently flew to California, outbound on A380 into LAX, returning to LHR from SFO on Boeing 747-400. Both legs in WT+ (Premium Economy). The Boeing 747-400 is very tired aircraft who BA seemingly are not investing in at all. The plastic surrounding the blind was coming away, the footrest (attached to the seat in front) did not go all the way down resulting in an uncomfortable seating position and the rest of the aircraft and area was just very old, tired and tatty. Despite BA insisting that the seat pitch is the same as the A380, it felt far more cramped, and much more like normal WT (Economy). Not helped by the Multimedia box and seat legs of the seat in front in exactly the wrong place to stretch out. The TV screens are very small and an old square format with far more limited programming compared with the A380. On the meal service, they ran out of the beef choice half way around the cabin service leaving only a vegetarian option (the helpful cabin crew did eventually find one from business class as WT+ gets the business class entree) but only as they had one left over. I feel if you pay for a service (at near-as-makes-no-difference twice the price of WT) with the word \"Premium\" in the title you should expect a premium product. BA do not offer free pre-seating (unless you book this 24 hours before departure thus you cannot guarantee to be seated together if the flight is full or near full), priority check-in, priority boarding, the pre-take-off drink is orange juice or water on all inbound flights. Additionally, despite BA boarding by seat row numbers, this was ignored by most passengers and ground staff alike so by the time we were called to board, the WT+ cabin was already full with very limited room for our carry on luggage, so it lucky that we travel very light! As you can tell, overall I feel that this was a lot of money for very little in return. Based upon our experience, I would recommend the WT+ in the A380 but only when departing from the UK (you can pre-order your meal and they serve wine as a pre-take off). In addition, WT+ on the 380 is upstairs in a small, cosy cabin, light and airy with a very useful storage bin on the window seats. These may be small points on their own, but combine to take the shine off a very expensive upgrade.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Checkin at Gatwick no problem at premium check in. Quickly through the fast track lane at Security,  the lounge at Gatwick was fairly busy though there was plenty of seating available. Flight boarded on time but by bus from a remote stand. Onboard service was efficient and friendly. Business Class has middle seat blocked out and turned into a table, armrest moved apart to give a wider seat than in economy. Breakfast was served, both options were actually very good - the champagne also not bad!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Aircraft was fine and journey smooth. Staff at airport helpful. The service however lacked shine expected from British Airways whilst on board. Staff showed little interest in passengers, minimal soft drinks offered, 2 on a 9 hour flight, bit of turbulence so not hot drinks provided, bring your own drinks.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Endured horrible British Airways return flights from Heathrow to Cape Town. The plane seems to be from the 1980s. Somehow the seats are really narrow, so that anyone with remotely broad shoulders spills over onto the seats next to them. I couldn't fit between a larger man one one side and a woman on the other and resorted to leaning forward for much of the flight. Thankfully a child was on one side on the way back. There were a number of flyers on the plane who had clearly done the route before as many refused to sit togther, forcing first-time flyers on the route like me to be squashed between them. The seats were also incredibly uncomfortable. The moulding on the back was took narrow and dug into my bag. I only fell asleep through sheer exhaustion, but woke up repeatedly with back pain from the seat. Other passengers walked around the cabin throughout the flight, while some resorted to sitting in the flight attendants' seats. Also the seats in front of the toilets don't fully recline. The TV controls are fixed into the arm rests which makes them uncomfortable to put your arm on and you inevitably press one of the buttons accidentally. The TVs themselves are about 30 years old, small and poor quality. The selection of movies was not great. It was very hot onboard the plane, and passengers repeatedly asked for the air conditioning to be turned up. The service was good on the way out, but the return flight service was poor. The staff appeared disinterested. One flight attendant responded rudely to me when I asked if I could use the overhead locker above my seat that had her bag in it. Another told the child next to me, when he asked for Sprite with his dinner, they had run out. Even though I saw a flight attendant drinking a can of Sprite 30 minutes later. Generally they seemed more interested in rushing through the service and stuffing their mouths than helping anyone. My call button was ignored twice. Another passenger pressed their's and the attendant simply came and turned it off then walked away. She said she'd be back in a moment, but didn't return. The food was generally ok.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways still trade on the 'you are lucky to be flying with us' mentality. 8am on a Friday morning, at the 'flagship' terminal at home base, and there are just 3 business class check-in desks open, so queued for nearly 30 minutes just to drop a bag. South Gallery lounge more like a refugee centre than a premier cabin lounge. People sleeping across sofas and chairs, full to almost standing-room only, but managed to perch on the arm of a sofa, before giving it up as a waste of time. Boarding very low-key, quick and easy. Excellent crew and very surprised by the level and quality of catering, and looked after well. It's the hardware that's so far below par. Business class seating is 8 across, that's like a lot of economy cabins. A window seat felt very cramped and claustrophobic. The cabin wall curved inwards and the seat is directly underneath where the hand-luggage bins sit, so it's quite an exercise to extricate yourself. No wifi, and although there's a video on demand system, it's the same fuzzy-focus, bleached-colour quality that I remember from when I first started flying with BA decades ago.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Not impressed. The cabin crew lacked energy and enthusiasm. Poor service. There was also rubbish left in the pocket of the seat in front of me when I boarded the plane. There were food crumbs on the table when I unclipped it and the magazines looked well used. I expected more from British Airways. I won't be flying with them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Was upgraded at the gate from Club World to First Class on a full flight. I am a loyal BA customer since 1996, and a Gold Tier member. Was welcomed and shown my seat, and the friendly young male flight attendant put my cabin bag in the overhead bin, before I did so. The suite has been modified a bit from the B777-236, but the seat remains the same, comfortable, but with a poorly-designed footrest. I opted for the Tasting Menu for lunch. It was quite good, but the food quality was not up to Cathay Pacific or Emirates First Class standards. High Tea was quite average, due to the dry sandwiches. The washrooms were clean but minimal, and the Club World washrooms on the Upper Deck of the A380 are much nicer. Pajamas and a wash bag were offered. AVOD was good. In-flight service by the same FA was very good, but the finesse of excellent First Class service was lacking a bit. Still he was always visible throughout the flight, and that was good. Arrived on time at IAD and the bags were on the carousel quickly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been a loyal BA customer since 1996, maintaining Gold Tier membership in recent years, and Silver Tier for many prior years. BA is consistent in the seat types it offers on its long haul fleet, but in-flight service and food can vary greatly. I connected from a Qatar Airways short haul flight in DOH to BA, at Hamad International Airport. I used the Al Mourjan Business Class Lounge and it worked out well. BA's Gate staff in DOH were clearly not familiar with the \"To Fly. To Serve\" slogan, judging by their attitude that day. Apart from a choice of water or orange juice upon boarding the Club World cabin, no service was provided on the very short hop to BAH. The flight attendants (one in particular) who served from BAH to LHR were very good. It was a Sleeper-Service, so the dinner menu was minimal, but breakfast didn't compensate well for that either. Cost-cutting was evident here. Thankfully, I didn't have to jump over anyone to access the aisle as many adjacent seats were empty. The cabin was clean, and AVOD was adequate, though it froze near LHR. The flight landed on time in LHR, but transferring through T5 was chaotic at 6:30 am. Baggage transfer was good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Never again with British Airways. Could not book seats, arrived into Rome (connecting flight) to be told there was no lounge facilities (no advanced notice, was not offered apology or use of other lounge or even a voucher). The flight and onboard service disappointing, business class seats are the same as economy apart from a tray secured to the middle seat which made getting in and out near imposable. Food laughable (3 finger sandwiches). No inflight entertainment. In sum, I will never fly British Airways again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Checked in online prior to departure expecting to use a British Airways online check in desk or fast bag drop on arrival at Manchester Airport. BA used to have a fast bag drop desk for customers who have checked in online. When I enquired as to where it was on arrival at Manchester Airport I was directed to the back of the long check in queue by a surly check in agent who stated, \"We don't have one. You have to join the back of the queue\". In that case what on earth is the benefit of checking in online?! It serves no purpose whatsoever. The shuttle down to Manchester was delayed by about an hour as was our onward flight from LHR to LAS. This flight was on one of their ancient B747-400 aircraft which was 25 years old, and it showed. The seats in economy were extremely uncomfortable for a 10.5 hour flight and there was no legroom. Inflight entertainment options were poor. I have never undertaken such an uncomfortable flight. The in flight catering was mediocre but the cabin crew provided good service. Our return flight from LAS to LHR was delayed by an hour and although we had booked to travel in and out from T5 at LHR I received an email half way through my trip informing me that we would be flying into T3 at LHR. As we were already delayed into LHR, by the time we had crossed to T5 our connecting flight to Manchester had already departed and we had to be booked onto another flight which meant we had been travelling for a total of 26 hours by the time we got home. BA made sure our travel experience was as miserable and inconvenient as possible. I have decided after many issues of late with BA that I can no longer be bothered with the hassle. If the flights are not delayed then they usually manage to lose my luggage. I have finally had enough and will use other carriers whenever I can.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I arrived at Heathrow after travelling for over 20 hours flying from Perth, Australia, to London. I had booked my British Airways flight online, and as I had not been to Heathrow before gave myself plenty of time to get through Customs and from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5. Total cost for return flights was $240.89Aus (113.68 pounds). I had booked the 8.05pm Heathrow flight to Belfast City Airport, but had got through Customer and to Terminal 5 just after 5pm. I went the to BA information desk to see if I could get an earlier flight. I was told yes, there was a flight leaving in about 30 minutes and if I paid for the change of outgoing flight it would not be a problem. I was told I would have to pay 110.00 pounds ($232.99 Aus) so I could get the earlier flight. Because I had been travelling for so long and just wanted to get to Belfast I paid the money. A flight that would normally cost approximately 80 pounds, one way, cost me 157.00 pounds one way. I will never travel with British Airways again, and would never recommend them. A total rip off for just over a 1hour flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Copenhagen with British Airways, and I was surprised by the service. Customer service was poor, particularly on my outward trip. Some of the cabin crew seemed disinterested and did not even greet you as you came onboard - they continued to talk amongst themselves and ignore customers. The seats were uncomfortable, and the little lunch they provided was atrocious.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Barcelona to London Heathrow and late again! British Airways really need to sort out their schedules. I can always guarantee a late out of foreign terminal, but early or on-time when flying outbound. Lateness is normally due to baggage or missing person or someone who has not turned up to travel. The food service is still complimentary thank goodness. You get a twin pack of a roll and currant bun on the Barcelona route - better than a huge panini they used to serve. Drinks service is extremely limited as always, one serving only of Tea/Coffee. For the price, using a schedule service into London Heathrow and complimentary light snack for just £39 was a bargain!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My son and his fiance travelled to St Kitts to get married. They spent ten days on their wedding-moon. When it was time to return they were unable to check in online. The website offered a phone number to call and there was no answer. They tried for three hours. They finally called me in the UK and I called British Airways. I was told that because I did not buy the tickets with my credit card, they couldn't help me. I was given another number to call. The second person I spoke to managed to resolve the problem that was preventing online check in, which meant that it was then possible. However, so much time had passed sorting this mess out that by the time we got into the system most of the seats were allocated and my son and his new bride could not sit next to one another for this long haul flight. When they tried to upgrade they were told it would be $1000US each. British Airways could not care less.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Maybe I've just flown US carriers too much, but I think British Airways is a cut above them, as it has been in the last few years. They take care of you during the flight. Multiple drink services with alcoholic beverages included, and water and orange juice through the flight. Hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering, and then a sandwich, tea, etc before landing. I am part of their frequent flyer program and was given a different seat from the one I had selected - the seat just behind the bulkhead. Ordinarily I don't like those seats as there's nowhere to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was \"better\"), so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine. Seat was wider than US economy, with more leg room, and a leg rest that came out from below, so quite comfortable. I can't ever say I enjoy a 7+ hour flight, but flying with British Airways makes it more bearable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having previously flown with British Airways a few years ago I was quite disappointed. The legroom was as expected and I had no complaints about that, but the food was awful and the service was terrible. We were sat next to a group of drunken passengers who were loud and were continued to be served drinks throughout. I am sure this didn't make the cabin crew job easy but they seemed quite disorganised - running out of drinks etc. As we were sitting in the back of the plane there seemed to be no choices by the time we were offered food - the crew were not really interested. When asked about an alternative they forgot to come back to us and when asked again they offered exactly what we refused. The food was poor quality, dry hard chicken with very little flavour. Breakfast was an egg mayonnaise roll and again there was no alternative. I paid extra to fly with British Airways but found the service and food lacking - really would not recommend flying long haul with them if you can help it. You can see they have made cuts to the budget!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Bologna return in British Airways Club Europe. Very disappointing. The seats are basically the same as economy seats, they just don't sit someone in the middle seat, so no meaningful increase in legroom or width. Food was very average on the way out (salad with very dry prawns, pretty tasteless) but nice on the way back (tagliatelle). Staff were on the whole were good, but given the seats I wouldn't recommend spending the extra money for Club Europe.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Checked in online for our British Airways flight from Larnaca to Heathrow. and discovered my wife and I were seated 4 rows apart. No seats together were available in the seating chart under \"manage my booking\". Is the BA software so poor that it can't keep 2 seats together when booked at the same time? The answer must be yes. The check-in person said they would try and get us two seats together when we presented at the gate, but as usual when you present at the bag-drop the staff member will say whatever is necessary to get you away and through security with minimum fuss and delay. In this case needless to say our separate seating remained separate. I wouldn't take the trouble to record this here except that I have felt irritated for the last few flights I've done with British Airways, with poor food, in-flight entertainment screens that work intermittently, faulty headphones, or being seated so that the only screen available is the other side of the business class dividing curtain which was drawn half way through the film. I've preferred British Airways on the basis that some of the budget operators charge you the same by the time you add their various extra charges. I'm now coming to the conclusion that if they charge the same I might as well fly with them and then I won't have to wait an extra 5 mins to get off the plane while the business class punters get off first.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After a small delay in AMS, we departed for short hop to LHR. Boarding went quickly, we were assigned emergency exit seats which were very comfortable.

      "Our British Airways flight to MIA departed on time and was full. We were seated in the middle front row, which has extra legroom and the IFE screens and traytables are stored in the seats. The first thing that caught our attention was the state of the cabin, and the interior looked old and worn. The same goes for the IFE and seats. Although the seats were comfortable by form and shape, they were worn and a bit hard to sit on. I had trouble with my IFE the whole flight as it froze and continuously reset itself while  trying to watch a movie. That was very annoying, but the cabin crew reset the system a couple of times and weren't annoyed by my questions about the problem. The cabin crew service was excellent, as was food.: 1 occurrences\n",

Very personal service before take off and this carried on for the flight.

Arrived on time and bags waiting when we got to the carousel.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First ever long haul trip with British Airways as I usually fly with Cathay Pacific or KLM so I thought I'd give BA a chance. Ground service at London/Heathrow Terminal 5 is smooth and no hassle. Check in and security was very fast and efficient. I particularly like BA's boarding procedure at Heathrow, very orderly and organised regardless of the fullness of the flight. Onboard the A380 is BA's new 'World Traveller' cabin on the main deck at 3x4x3 configuration. BA offers 31.5 inches legroom compared to CX's 32 inches and it was surprisingly very comfortable with the slim design seats. IFE had a few glitches but the FA's were happy to assist and worked perfectly throughout the flight. However, more movies, TV programmes and music options could be offered. Meals were mediocre. Drinks were served around an hour after take off. Meals followed straight after. Lunch meal option was either curry, vegetarian pasta or chicken and often for the latter. Surprisingly good but still not as good as CX. Portions could be better. Drinks were offered throughout the flight along with snack boxes. Pre-landing meal was also given with two options: pasta or chicken casserole, I went for the latter. Again, portions could be better. Overall, I would fly long haul with BA again on their new product (A380, B777-300ER and B787).: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew with British Airways for my family holiday to and from Sharm El Sheikh from London Gatwick. I checked in online both ways 24 hours before which was fine and all went well. However, I have a special dietary need and I was not able to click on this for the flight. With BA, you get meals, snacks and drinks included so I knew that we would have a meal with a 5 hour flight. While on board, I was able to choose the fruit option for breakfast on the way there - however on the way back it was a cold deli option which consisted of a wrap, a roll and some crackers. I asked if there was a gluten free option and the assistant said \"No just this\". Following this we could have pretzels and biscuits with a drink. Obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers. BA really need to address this as it is not fair to advertise they provide meals on board when clearly there was nothing available for me. Luckily I always carry my own food with me and I did not starve. Also I didn't know why there was no inflight entertainment for such a a long flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew return with British Airways from BKK on a 777-200 in premium economy. Don't bother paying extra to pre-book the seats, we paid £160 to reserve seats 12A/12B outward journey and seats 12G/12H return journey and never got what we paid for. On bringing the seat change to the attention of staff at BKK, was told sorry, system make a mistake. On a positive note the staff were working hard and water and juice was offered frequently on the day flight. The female staff on flight BA0010 looked as if the did not want to be there, very abrupt and surly looking. On the other hand the male staff on this flight were very professional, smiling and very attentive. British Airways need to work a bit harder and update the grubby fleet on this route as the Asian airlines offer a better product. Blankets shabby in business / premier elite. The inflight films / ancient music very limited. Come on BA wake up your losing customers and need to up your game. What was once a great airline is going downhill.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Heathrow Galleries lounge overcrowded and under staffed. Tables covered in used plates and glasses which staff were not clearing. Many empty dishes at the buffet. Unacceptably bad. The Dreamliner was comfortable but disappointing in a new aircraft to find that there is still a lack of easy access storage space and shelves next to the seat. As ever, a pre loaded tray with ill fitting tablecloth plonked in front of you. Food service more a Premium Economy product than club. No window blinds but a gimmicky and slow system which dims the Windows and was rather unsatisfactory. Overall a mediocre performance from BA which needs to up its business class game, particularly on new generation aircraft.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very comfortable flight in the Club World Cabin. The amount of personal space is rather limited and it is frustrating having to climb over your prostrate neighbour's legs. That said the Club World seats are very comfortable when a) upright, b) in \"z\" lounging position and c) as flat bed. In fact much more comfortable and sleep inducing than the much larger and spacious seats on the new Singapore Airlines 777s which appear amazing but simply are not comfortable. The big let down in BA Club is the food. Plonked in front of you on a plastic try with a table cloth that doesn't fit. Then the condiments arrive in those ghastly sachets that look more at home in a transport cafe. I like the seats despite the lack of personal and storage space but Willie Walsh is going too need to improve the food offer which falls well behind the Asian and ME3 carriers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I purchased a Club World return to Narita in the Black Friday sale. It cost £1,010.06 which is a bargain for a direct business class return from Heathrow to Tokyo. The lounge at Heathrow was not crowded and boarding was prompt. I had pre booked my seat, rear facing by the window. I was sitting comfortably when a Japanese gentleman arrived and told me I was sitting in his seat. I told him it was my seat. I asked to see his boarding pass which was for my seat. I showed him my electronic boarding pass which was for the same seat. At this stage the Purser was passing and we raised the issue. I decided to stand my ground as I was happy with my pre booked seat. The Purser went away to investigate. When he returned, he apologised for the error and quietly asked me to follow him and said I would not be disappointed. I was let to the front row of the First Class seats and enjoyed an excellent flight to Tokyo with splendid service and first class food and fine wines. Very spacious suite with comfortable seat and dedicated wardrobe. An excellent flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew with British Airways to St Lucia on flight number BA2159 on 28/7/15 and returned on flight number BA2158 on 9/8/2015. The journey to St Lucia was pleasant enough as we were upgraded from economy to premium economy due to spare seats. Unfortunately however the upgrade meant that my husband and I no longer had seats together (as I has with the seats I'd pre-booked) and as this was our honeymoon this was quite important for us. The journey home however was extremely disappointing. On finding our seats we discovered that the plane had not been cleaned since the previous journey. There were empty sweet wrappers in the pocket and crumbs all over the seat and on the floor. We were not offered a new pillow and blanket and instead we're left the ones used by previous customers. In my case blanket scrunched up on floor with pillow on top. In comparison with other long haul flights we have travelled on with Virgin and Emirate,s British Airways seemed to provide much less space and poorer facilities. Needless to say the flight was an uncomfortable one for many reasons. On future holidays we will be returning to other flight operators.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I recently got an unexpected upgrade to World Traveller Plus whilst on my way to New York. There was free cava before take-off and a random hot towel handed out. The seat was roomy and leg room was fantastic. Even more so because I was at the front of the World Traveller Plus cabin just after Club World, so there were no seats in front of me. Inflight entertainment was ok, but not as good as I was expecting. I did struggle to find things that interested me to watch as the choice was quite limited. I think now with early digital release of many films on things like i-Tunes, the days of being able to see really recent films on aircraft before they become more widely available are coming to an end. As I was at the front of the cabin I had a screen that folded out of my armrest, which meant I was looking down at the screen instead of straight ahead, which gave me a bit of a neck ache after awhile. It was also annoying to stow away. The food was good for airline food. You get a superior meal in World Traveller Plus and it was pretty tasty and filling. The pre-landing snack wasn't up to much though. It was a dull sandwich, much like those that BA hand out on short-haul European flights. A real bonus about being in World Traveller Plus is that you're closer to the front of the plane and the exit. This is useful when arriving in the US where immigration queues can sometimes be exceptionally long. I ended up being close to the front of the immigration queue as I was so quick off the plane, which meant I was out through immigration pretty quickly. I think to pay for World Traveller Plus would be quite expensive for what you get in some respects (essentially a nicer meal and more leg room) but it was a nice treat from BA and If you were going on a super long haul flight I can definitely see the attraction.: 1 occurrences\n",

AVIOS worked, must have been lucky. Young flight crew, so I assume new MF types, so not that much interaction, but non the less efficient. Food 8/10 for both dinner and breakfast. Flight made up some time so nearly on schedule. Bags first of carousel, so all in all a good travel experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very nice and helpful staff in Terminal 5, very nice and friendly cabin crew. Food was good too. Very smooth flight and on time. I have flown 6 times in last two weeks with different flights and I was flying with my 3 year old son. British Airways was the only flight where the cabin crew came from time to time came to ask if my child needed anything. She brought him a bag with a colouring book and pens without asking.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Ground handling is not great at Bari but once on board was quickly forgotten. Great flight with attentive cabin crew. Delicious afternoon tea with unlimited Champagne. Very good experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First and last time travelling with British Airways. The flight outw was reasonable, although they are sadly lacking in comparison to other airlines. My first question is does anybody from British Airways actually read these comments? If they do how can they go on providing a service that is so bad? We arrived in Toronto on 9th September to be told our luggage had been left at Heathrow along with 80 other bags. They were well prepared at Toronto to deal with us having been forwarned of the problem - after filling in the relevant forms we were informed that our bags would be with us in 24 hours, nut it was 2.5 days later when we were finally reunited with them. British Airways should investiage the company they use in Toronto as they were extremely rude when we telephone to enquire when they thought the bags would be delivered, even hanging up on the Hotel Manager who tried to help us. Only after my Husband asked where they were and said he would collect the bags himself did we get an answer, and then it took until 9.00 p.m. on the Friday to be delivered. The final straw was having paid extra for two seats together by the window on the return journey, we found out upon checking in that we could not have these seats and we had to sit in a row of 4 - not a problem normally. but it had cost £90.00 extra to book these seats, and not one of the staff was interested, just a take or leave it attitude.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Amsterdam, check in on line and bag drop quick and easy, used Galleries North Lounge at T5. It was fairly busy but able to find a seat. Boarding the full flight orderly and quick seat 2A. Cabin crew fine, a simple meal served on the 50 min flight. Arrival more or less on time, however the bags seemed to take forever - 50 min. Having used the same route 2 weeks previously in economy, I must say for the difference in fare I feel British Airways have really missed a trick! Seats are just the same, the meal nothing special added to the change in the Executive club Avious accrual. I really think apart from the one business class I've already booked, I won't bother in future with British Airways Club Europe. Instead I'll look for the most convenient and cheapest ticket when flying in Europe.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Don't ever fly with British Airways! We went Cancun for our honeymoon, and on the way there they seated my husband at the opposite end of the plane - only 48 hours of being married. When we arrived in Cancun our bags didn't make it there, so we had to wait 4 days for our bags and go out and buy some clothes. Travelling back they lost them again, so not only did they lose our bags once but twice and had to wait 4 days again for them. I advise anyone reading this to not waste your money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Crew were excellent, friendly and efficient, seats adequate for Premium Economy service, plenty of legroom and good recline, entertainment good. Food was good if you could get the meal you preferred. Suggest persons allocating the choices research better into preferences, as we struggled to get first choice on all sectors (seated in last row of Premium Economy.  Criticisms would be that British Airways charge extra for you to select seats prior to ensure you are sitting next to your companion and there is no priority check-in or boarding/luggage. Toilets are in economy cabin and could be lengthy waits, whilst other airlines provide dedicated toilets for Premium Economy. However, the fare for SYD-LHR return pretty good value.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Do not waste your money. Quite simply British Airways premium economy from London to Bangkok return was pathetic. Economy class food is served, plastic not glass for drinks. The seats are marginally wider than economy class, but I could not eat my food without lifting the plate from my tray to my mouth. I bought a bottle of scotch on return to Heathrow, and then transferred to Manchester flight. The bottle was confiscated by Security because it was not sealed by staff onboard. I called BA customer service who said it was my fault because I should have told the purser I was going on to Manchester. Staff were generally good but never again on British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked a British Airways trip from Sydney to London via Singapore through travel agent, not knowing the Business Class seating plan (big mistake on my part). Seat plan is 2-4-2 . We were allocated seats 15e and 15f. The 2 middle seat in the block of 4, so was flying backwards. Seats are too cramped, compared to other airlines, no storage space apart from a small draw to store a laptop. A plastic privacy screen is all that separated me from the person in the aisle seat and that had to be lowered and raised when cabin crew served meals and drinks. When the aisle seat was made into flat bed, I had to climb over person to use bathroom etc. This could be a problem for less mobile passengers. You should not expect to have to do this with the cost of flying business class The cabin crew provided good service and food was okay. This is the first and last time I will be using British Airways to fly business class, unless they change the seating configuration for business class.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We had flown London to Johannesburg return with British Airways in May 2015, and were underwhelmed. This time was a huge improvement. Pleasant, efficient staff, glass of fizzy to welcome us whch is better than orange juice. The food was good, especially the steak which was also good on the return flight. Nice wine served by cheerful cabin crew. Brandy after meal, brought without hesitation. Water brought during night. The A380 is staggeringly quiet with good AV system. Very comfy, I have a short body and long legs.  Wailing child all night.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "There are so many poor reviews here for British Airways, and I am just about to add another one. The return trip started in the shared lounge at Pisa. Its comfortable enough - but forget it if you are hungry. There is no food to snack on - just a few bags of crisps, nuts and sealed croissants. Booze choice is okay. Quite why, in Italy of all places, a platter of mixed meats, cheeses and typical antipasti cannot be provided - probably costing about £50 a day, is a mystery. British Airways don't care. No airbridge so a trudge to the plane. It was an ex BMI A319 and given they ceased trading three years ago one would think that the internal software could be changed to show British Airways branding and not BMI; very strange. Old BA Club Europe. Tired seats. FAs were fine. Food mediocre. Funny thing was the cabin smelt of a rather tasty \"meaty\" sort of meal. As we took off I was starving and full of optimism. All we got was a miserable afternoon tea; dried sandwiches, scones and jam. I compensated my gloom with a few gin and tonics. I asked myself, is this \"worth it\" - the extra for the product. What you get I suppose is a toilet for 12/14 passengers, compared with two toilets between 120 or so.  Wider seats (no extra legroom).  A meal over economy but not by much,  glasses to drink from rather than plastic beakers and a faster exit from the plane,  a few extra AVIOS points - that's it basically! Not a lot. Anyway we left 10 minutes early and arrived 20 minutes ahead of schedule. Nice smooth flight but I could have had that on Ryanair. British Airways really don't care as the many reviews on here clearly show.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Sydney via Singapore in business class. I am English born and have always had an affinity with British Airways. I had not flown with them for a while and booked business class seats for my wife and I, and have to say how underwhelmed we were with the whole experience and will not be trying them again. They are so far behind other airlines - you expect in business class to feel just a bit special, but as reviewed earlier you do not get any special service. A lousy check in, herded along with the rest on boarding, a lousy inflight toiletry bag. As for the food, just awful on both legs to Sydney. The crew on the London to Singapore were unengaging, at least the 2nd leg crew were better. The bad news is that I still have the return leg to LHR with them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Antigua to Gatwick. A shabby aircraft, my seat was broken, it would recline without command, the head rest was broken and the seat covers were very worn. The inflight entertainment had to be re set as it wasn't working and when it did work my screen did not display the safety briefing, images would freeze, in effect I did not receive the briefing. The cabin staff refused to dispose of my wife's drink because it was not finished, I had to request another hostess to take it. The food was poor quality in general too, looked like a kids meals, pasta with cheese. Check in was good, queues were long but the staff were very helpful and the flight left on time. British Airways is not in the league of other long haul carriers like Emirates, a lot of work to be done to refresh it's image.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Absolutely disappointing experience. Flight was delayed by more than 2 hours but ground staff were unfriendly and unwilling to help arrange transport options even though plane touched down after midnight with no public transport options available. Reason was claimed to be weather but both Aberdeen and London experienced good weather, with no other flights being delayed in both locations. Concocted reason to fool passengers. Would not recommend this airline previous two flights have been delayed for at least an hour each.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Not sure who invented these seats but they are awful. Difficult to get in and out if you are inside. Has not flown British Airways for a number of years but they have not improved in this time, food still very mediocre and service the same. You even had to pay in advance to select a seat, which we did. However, when we checked in, we were told sorry crew using the seats you paid for! Still waiting for my refund. Inflight entertainment is rubbish - movies well past their sell by date. Back to Emirates for us.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I do not like this new business class arrangement in short haul. I am wondering if is is worth paying a premium for no extra leg room and a side table. New seats are better. Service attentive. Food okay.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Slight delay. Games advertised on website, not able to access in economy. TV not working for 1st hour, then when it did, couldn't hear it though the provided headphones, so had to choose film with subtitles. Although staff doing their jobs, the 3 near us seemed to have an attitude, a man behind asked for a cup of tea and the flight assistant muttered under his breath. My partially sighted mother asked politely for milk with her tea and the flight assistant, made her feel stupid by shoving it in her face and sarcastically saying \"there it is\". I realise she didn't know my mother was partially sighted, but maybe she should be aware that you can't always see people's disabilities. I had no problem with our outbound flight to Denver from Heathrow, (except the headphones) the staff on that plane were all very pleasant, I will think twice before booking BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A slight delay in boarding (BA 816 - scheduled departure 12:55) resulted in priority boarding being suspended for general boarding. Hardly had the wheels left the ground before the person in row 1F (I was seated in 2F) reclined his seat back as far as it would go. When one of the cabin crew walked past (seat belt sign, still on) I asked if this was allowed. To my astonishment, I was told that yes it was. It was my understanding that the seat back must be in the upright position while the seatbelt sign is on during climb.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check in agent at Glasgow was very cheerful and polite. Both crews were efficient and polite, if not particularly engaging. In economy it was a very standard service. I like the new seats on both aircraft. What I don't like is having to transfer from T5 to T3 at Heathrow. Over the past several years I seem to always end up travelling to the destinations requiring this transfer, which adds a lot of time and hassle to what would be an extremely efficient domestic to international connection at T5.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from Gatwick on 09/08/15 to Genoa to join a cruise. Whilst the aircraft was clean, everything else seems to be very old and fit for purpose for a display at a museum. At the back only one toilet was working. Seats very cramped and not comfortable. It was an 8am flight, to my horror only a small cold croissant with a bit of none descriptive cheese in the middle was served with a hot drink. Bearing in mind the flight price on Skyscanner for could have cost over GBP500 pounds. In the good old days British Airways flights from Manchester to Heathrow lasting about an hour served hot breakfast. It appears British Airways does not want to maintain its quality image and I am really disappointed on this flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was my first flight on a British Airways aircraft with the new, slimmer seats and I was quite appalled by the seat pitch (space between rows). The seat back in front of me (I was seated in 14C) was so close to my face that I could not hold up a magazine to read. I had to try to twist sideways in my seat and hold the magazine in the aisle. I passed on the light breakfast that was served because it just seemed like too much trouble to try and eat from a plastic box that would have been almost pressed against my chest. The cabin crew on my flight was very pleasant and professional and the aircraft interior was immaculate, but in the future I'll avoid British Airways within Europe. The single-aisle aircraft of Air France, which I fly regularly, are far more comfortable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "They sold me tickets without any luggage allowance. I paid £100 to add 3 bags using their online system. When I took the return flight they charged me again. But this time double. So a reasonable £200 pound flight ended up costing me £600. I'll never fly with them again. They're more expensive than everyone else, and they've totally changed their luggage terms. What a complete rip off.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "London Heathrow to Venice with British Airways, I was lucky to sit in row 1 of the Club Europe cabin where you get the most legroom. Unfortunately the rest of the cabin has the same seat pitch as Euro Traveller. The seats are comfortable for a short flight and the service to around 16 passengers was good, with good quality food and drinks served.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Short flight from London to Paris but completely full. Easy check in and smooth boarding. Problem is how inconsistent British Airways is in regard to baggage allowed in the cabin. Some people have two or three big bags when I thought only one was allowed. So this then puts pressure on passengers with just one to put in the lockers with the crew trying to get them to put the bag by their feet. Why should they? I carry less on the plane to be able to have foot space - why should I give that up when someone else brings on more bags. This needs to be looked at. Short flight - on time and service on board ok given that timeframe.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Recently there have been more delays and this particular British Airways trip was worse still. I was originally booked to fly from London City to Geneva first thing in the morning but the flight got cancelled. I did not receive so much as an email from BA about this. The only way I found it was cancelled was by going into my original confirmation email as the flight did not even register on the British Airways App. My replacement flight was from Heathrow so I had to make my way all the way across London (at my own expense) to get that flight which then ended up being delayed by 1 hour! British Airways for some years has been a great airline but I fear cracks are starting to appear!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Munich return with British Airways. I have never published a negative review of anything ever before, I work in the service industry and have several friends who are cabin crew. I am not a demanding passenger, I rarely request anything unless invited to do so and I rarely request anything other than water. However my first experience of British Airways business class was let down by crew serving me. The female cabin attendant on my return flight could not have been nicer, but the male attendant on my flight out was noticeably dismissive of me as a female passenger. To the men sitting near me he was chatty and offering them extra drinks etc. I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience. Such a shame and it has made me reconsider whether the extra cost is worthwhile.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Denver to London with British Airways. We were allocated rubbish seats near the toilets. The seats would recline but would creep forward during the night which bent the jack in my headphones.  Lately we've found the aircraft are tired and in much need of an update. Poor quality screens - very small seats. Not much bigger than a short haul flight. Find the air hostess / stewards are often quite bored and provide a no thrills service. There's not much wrong with them per se, but a smile would go a long way. We now specifically look for other airlines to fly with as we've had enough of British Airways for long haul flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been loyal British Airways and found little to complain about. The last two long hauls I have done this year with BA has seen the passengers wearing winter coats when flying to the tropics due to the cabin being kept freezing. But my main complaint is the nice little earner BA have come up with where you pay seat allocation and extra for bulkhead or emergency exit seats where there is more leg room. I have now paid the high rate on numerous occasions only to find the plane configuration has changed and I am in a regular seat, the crew have been known to ask me for proof! Today's flight was no exception, I wasn't even given an apology or a refund but told to keep my voice down. The crew looked tired and just going through the motions. My loyalty may have come to an end and I am seriously considering Air Mauritius or Emirates for my next trip.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A very smooth and pleasant flight from start to finish. The bag drop queue at Terminal 5 was long but moved reasonably fast. Onboard a small snack of crisps and a drink was served, which was fine. The flight operated on time. My only quibble was that a label was put on my backpack instructing me to keep it at my feet, presumably so that other people with unreasonably large take-on bags could easily put them in the overhead bins (while I suffered less legroom than them). Apart from the safety issue of hand baggage stuck on the floor, this policy penalises people who do the right thing and encourages others to take big items of \"hand\" luggage. Come on, BA, enforce a your hand luggage rules and don't penalise considerate passengers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The staff were not friendly or even helpful. A pregnant lady beside me asked for help with her carry on and the rude answer was if you can't carry it don't bring it on board.

The lady beside my daughter was not given food and when she asked for it, the flight attendant answered in a loud voice 'I did ask you' (which did not happen).

      "Cape Town to London Heathrow. The new British Airways lounge at Cape Town is a big improvement on the lounge that used to be shared with Virgin, however it filled up quickly with passengers for the two flights. Our new First class seats (2A/3A) were already showing their age, so the plane was probably one of the first to be retrofitted. Unfortunately, the crew in First were young and disinterested. Neither of us were addressed by our names at any point during the flight. The dinner service was slow and the food mediocre (cold and dry or overcooked and dry). Ironically, they ran out of the South African white wine. The entertainment system wasn't working for most of the flight. British Airways should provide an iPad alternative in First when that happens. PJs and the flat bed made up with a duvet are good touches, but the flight was too turbulent for uninterrupted sleep. The Boeing 747-400 toilets are ridiculously small for changing in and out of clothes. Overall, the experience was underwhelming.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways are not the upmarket world class brand they were. Fact. Everything is about saving whilst extorting. The lounge at Gatwick and T5 had no hot food until certain times - like school.  A while back they're was always superb Lounge food and not salty kettle chips! People have paid for this and British Airways is not delivering which is really wrong. Bought sandwich from downstairs because lounge had no decent food. Onboard only a tiny amount of Club World passengers, yet they ran out of preferred meal choices. Starting to wonder just how the cabin crew are treated, because if they are treated the way passengers are, no wonder they've stopped caring. So sad for what was an iconic brand.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Travelled British Airways from London Heathrow to Buenos Aires return in Business Class. Business class layout is terrible with very narrow seats which are arrangend in way that almost in any seat you book, somebody will step over you during the night or you have to step over somebody else. In addition, there are screens between and your neighbor's seat which flight attendants have to move up and down when they want to serve passengers who do not have an aisle seat. I can't imagine how stupid the person who created this layout must have been. It is not comfortable for passengers nor is it for flight attendants. Very sticky atmosphere due to this odd arrangement of seats. In terms of service, this was lousy on both flights. There are about 4 flight attendants for about 40 Business Class seats. The flight attendants are quite old. It takes them a long time to get you something to drink on the table after take-off. They move through the cabin twice with drinks before they serve dinner and desert. Afterwards you don't see them and they may not show up even if you press the call button. Their attitude is by and large correct, but very formal and impersonal. They clearly don't display any signs of fun or interest in the customer. Food was reasonable. No Wifi available at all.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight and crew great, the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. Total nightmare and they just did not care at all. Our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. When arriving at Orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. We noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry, as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. Even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. Eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. On returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we can't give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. Eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and £25 voucher. I won't be flying with British Airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The British Airways seats were extremely small, uncomfortable and did not operate properly. In order to recline the seat or return it to the upright position you had to do it manually. The bathrooms throughout the plane were dirty and smelly from the minute we boarded. The meals British Airways served were abysmal. On the way home from London to the U.S. passengers had the choice of a chicken curry dish with saffron rice or the vegetarian option. The smell of curry makes me nauseated so I opted for the vegetarian dish. I was served greasy, overly seasoned pasta soaked in oil and covered with a soggy bread crumb topping. It was inedible. My partner received the chicken curry dish which was small, fatty pieces of chicken overly seasoned and soaked oil. The dishes served are poorly chosen for the general population of people who fly British Airways. The food should be clean, fresh food not covered in grease and oil and not overly seasoned. The portions are too small and the dessert items chosen are also odd and not appealing to people. It appears British Airways will serve just about anything so they can keep the food prices down and the profits up.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways, and a farcical flight to be honest. 2 hours into a 10 hour flight running out of beer for those who drink is a joke. Not having the choice of food by the time it comes to you on 4 occasions over the 2 flights is pathetic - I guess you need to really consider where you book your seats by asking where they start serving from. I thought air stewardesses were meant to at least crack a smile once and again, and when asked reasonable questions (that had to be asked due to the ridiculous shortages) were meant to be as accommodating and friendly as possible? Hope I never have to fly with British Airways again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Smooth take off and landing. Plane about 75%  full, mostly business people. The \"meal\" was past terrible. A horrible, tiny, dry bread bun with a the smallest piece of chicken ever and the most salty bacon I have ever tasted. The best part was the sticky bun that followed, washed down with lemonade. No entertainment for this 1hr 45min flight. The toilets were barely passable, had they been cleaned from the previous flight?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I'm not one for publishing reviews but following discussions of flight problems, have just heard of Skytrax. I have lost track of the numbers of flights I've taken over the years, on business in Europe and on holiday worldwide. With family in the US, regular flights have almost exclusively till now been with British Airways: some economy, some WTP, more recently in Business. Service, value etc has to now ranged from acceptable to good, occasionally excellent. Shame things seem to have changed. For our annual trip last December I booked my 7-year old daughter and myself on British Airways LHR to Chicago, returning from Washington Dulles to LHR. Both flights in Business Class. Booking process online reasonably good, with helpful assistance from a \"real person\" when there was a problem - which happened 3 times in the months before departure. No common sense used when flights are cancelled and \"suitable alternatives\" booked, when seats had been pre-purchased, when clearly travelling with a child. Check-in and departure were smooth. Travel in economy means that they feed children first. Travel in business and they serve children serve after the adults.  The \"child meal\" (when it eventually arrived) was a disgrace, I wouldn't feed it to an animal! Peas blackened, mash dried and crusty. Not surprisingly she didn't want it. Ended up eating my meal. Entertainment screen (essential for children and part of the treat of the journey) didn't work, so we swopped seats - so no entertainment screen for Mummy! Thank goodness I had my Kindle. No apologies from staff. More interested in the male business travellers. Return flight after Christmas from  Washington Dulles to LHR was slightly better. Evening meal available in lounge prior to boarding - providing you're an adult. Again nothing for children except some biscuits. If I'm willing to pay British Airways Business Class fares for myself and my daughter, I expect better service than this. Very disappointed. Will I fly BA again? Yes, but grudgingly and once the airmiles are used up who knows?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Nairobi to London with British Airways. The service was good, except that they gave given up on collecting jackets. Seat is getting tired - bits coming off. Disgraceful level of cleanliness - between the seat and the side of the cabin was a very old accumulation of fluff, mouldy peanuts, crumbs, an old sandwich wrapper and a mini mars bar (very old). Felt sick. Given this was highlighted in the press recently - it must be that British Airways really does not care.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outward on the 06.30 flight 7th September - good all the way. Snack was fine, coffee nice. Staff were great. Checked in on ine but long queue for bag drop - BA need to improve this. Security again a long queue but that is reflective of the troubled times we live in I fear. Return on 16.35 flight 22nd September - everything fine except seat 11b in permanent recline (didn't realise it until I got told about it prior to landing so apologised to lady behind me). Sandwich and Red wine were nice. Considering I booked early and got a great price, I have no complaints. Flight deck information good both ways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I recently travelled British Airways from Phoenix to London Heathrow. This is my 3rd time I have flown this route onboard one of the Boeing 747-400 and I must say British Airways have got to either fully upgrade their B747 fleet or retire the aircraft. The seats are far too cramped and not comfortable, the in flight entertainment had to be rebooted several times as they stopped working or didn't work at all, the heat in the cabin was unbearable at times and very uncomfortable. The only plus points were crew who were very attentiveand willing to help and the food wasn't too bad. I am aware that around 18 Boeing 747's are getting refitted but by the look of it unfortunately the B747 on the Phoenix route is not, and for me as the route I travel, causes me concern and has me wondering if I will travel with BA again.  Not everyone can afford to fly business or first but that doesn't mean that we give up on the right to have a little space to move, seats that don't feel like they are going to cripple you, have an entertainment system that works and has a better selection of movies/tv shows/music. Other airlines such as Emirates have a fabulous system even in economy so why can't British Airways use the same type of technology. If BA want to compete, please do something about it.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check-in for my British Airways flight at Gatwics North Terminal with no queue and staff friendly and chatty. Boarding was quick. The A319 had not yet been fitted with the new seats, but they were still comfortable and moderately spacious. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The return journey was also quite good, except the flight was change to a 01:10 departure instead of 23:40 so it meant that nearly most shops (except duty free) at Alicante were closed. Also it meant that the flight arrived back into Gatwick at 02:40 which wasn't very pleasant as we had to then drive another hour and a half home. British Airways Gatwick operation is quite good and punctual not like Heathrow.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "These British Airways flights were undoubtedly the worst we've ever had to South Africa in ten years of travelling there. The seats were narrow, lumpy and incredibly uncomfortable especially for a long haul journey. I thought initially that we were unlucky and got broken or faulty seats on our outward journey, but they were just as bad on the return journey. To add insult to injury, we'd selected and paid for seats of our preference, but when we got to the airport for our return journey we were told the seats were gone, and simply told we would have to apply for a refund. The worst aspect of the flight however, was the heat. The aircraft was oppressively hot and stuffy for hours on the way from Johannesburg to London. Many passengers complained but the crew could apparently do nothing because the air conditioning system appeared too old to regulate the temperature. Also the entertainment system had to be switched off and rebooted several times because many passengers' consoles were not working. There were passengers who had to do without entertainment for the entire 10 hour flight. These aircraft are not fit for flying and should have been retired a decade ago. Pity the poor crew who have to work on these clapped-out aircraft every day. We've been travelling to South Africa several times a year for the past decade and this was our first time travelling with British Airways. Clearly it will also be our last. Avoid British Airways or their Boeing 747-400s at all costs.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Vienna to London Heathrow return in September 2015, both flights in Economy on an A320. Crew pleasant but not doing more than absolutely required. A snack and drinks were served on both legs. This time the sandwich consisted of a mini pastrami and cheese sandwich and a mini black currant bun. Edible, but not BA´s best sandwich offering.  Additional drinks were served on request. Both legs featured the new slim seats in the cabin with reduced legroom. While the seat are slightly better than the Recaro slim seats, I miss the older more comfortable seats with better leg room. I did not really realize that BA has changed the rules recently and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). Also, if one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR75 at the airport or EUR35 on line.  The final fare with BA can be substantially higher than the initial price quote - the additional charges are displayed during the booking process and if one commits to checking luggage during the booking process, the charges are lower. With the exception of a free drink and sandwich, British Airways Economy product is now pretty much a low-cost airline product. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checking luggage. While VIE-LHR was on time, the return LHR-VIE leg was delayed for one hour. After a timely boarding the full plane was waiting for the departure, but then the flight deck announced that they are waiting for some cargo to be loaded and they missed their assigned slot, which meant waiting an hour for a new slot. So, basically BA inconvenienced a whole plane of passengers to load some delayed cargo. Flying with hand baggage only, I used web check-in for both flights which worked fine. Boarding procedures were unremarkable and pleasant. BA uses a shared lounge in VIE. The Lounge as such is acceptable (small and mostly packed), but far from great with limited and lower quality offerings. The selection seems to be more or less the same in all lounges in VIE. BA Galleries Lounge in LHR T3 a comfortable oasis amid a busy airport and food and drinks selection was better than VIE. Wine selection was nice. BA still uses T3 for its flights to VIE, which I consider a huge benefit over using T5, which tends to be a mess for passengers. While I stopped flying British Airways Business in Europe they BA changed Business seating to Economy seats with no additional legroom, I see no valid reason to pay any surcharge for this product, but I still consider BA one of the better options for Economy flights in Europe. However their new low-cost airline concept also means that the times when I was willing to pay higher prices just for flying with BA over easyJet or Austrian on this route are unfortunately over.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to San Francisco with British Airways and unimpressed. Checked in online but had a bag to drop: I was issued with a fresh boarding pass at the airport, and was there plenty early enough. Everything seemed normal until I reached the gate for boarding - the scanner at the final checkpoint reported \"not checked in\". After a 5 minute or so wait, I was allowed to board, but moved to a different seat (I was told this was the final one, but not given any explanation as to why). Once on the plane, I was asked to move to what turned out to be my original seat. I filled in BAs feedback form about this and asked what was going on, but they were apparently receiving a high volume of complaints and never responded. In the circumstances, I think I'll stick with more reliable airlines from now on. The flight itself was delayed by a 1/2 hour while they waited for \"more passengers\". The flight itself was uneventful, and the meals and service okay for economy. Having said that, the Boeing 747 is horribly outdated, and the IFE system repeatedly failed and had to be rebooted.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways is an airline with a very mixed quality. I am flying it very often and I think that quality is decreasing over the last few months.  Whereas lounges are great and the staff is almost nice, the flight attendants sometimes are unfriendly. On this flight one flight attendant hit me twice with his cabin trolley and did not even excuse himself. The aircraft and the seats in Premium Economy are quite good including food and drinks.  But the worst with BA is customer support and help with problems. On my outbound flight from PHL to LHR I had a problem with reserving a seat. Although it was shown as free in the map (no bassinet!) I was not able to select it. First time calling the customer support I was told this is a technical error. Second time the lady told me that this is not bookable as this is next to a bassinet. Then one day later is was reserved. I called again and they told me that I was too late. Any hint on my two other calls was answered with \"that's your problem. You have a seat what is the problem?\". I mean at least she is right but the attitude is extremely bad and maybe there is a reason why I want to have this seat. My email with a complaint on this wasn't answered till today excet for the automated we will answer asap. If British Airways continue with that customer service I might change shortly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Heathrow to Manchester - ok it's only a 35 min flight but about a one hour delay with no explanation before take off and no apology from the flight deck. I booked a seat near the front and was moved to the very back row 'because of a change of aircraft'. There I could hear every word of conversation from the young cabin crew in the galley. And not all things the passengers should be hearing. Torn uniform on female attendant, brusque drinks service from male steward who gave the impression that the job is a bit beneath him. Waiting ages for the plane to empty so I could get off. Crew not helping anyone and no eye contact for the dismal goodbye on getting off.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I travelled from London to Sydney via Singapore in British Airways first class. I found the service outstanding, food was good lots of choices and the wine list was also good. Seat was comfortable, but the thing I would fault is that the armrest does stick in to you when in the sleep position.  Would fly them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bengaluru to Heathrow. My first long haul flight with British Airways and I am not at all impressed. The service levels were disgusting. No ear plugs, No eye shades even after requests.  Drink service only a showpiece. Asked for a Virgin Mary and was give iced tomato juice with lemon. When asked for other ingredients like Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, Salt and Pepper, I was told that this was the airline recipe. My request for some salt and pepper to spice my drink was refused saying that `we do not stock them in Economy'. When I requested for a talk with the Head of Staff on the aircraft, he was sorry and said the airline was trying to cut corners and the crew pleas were falling on deaf years.  Only vegetarian dinner option provided since they had apparently run out. No menus etc. IFE selection with dated screens and headsets.  Was a Low cost carrier experience that takes a passenger from Point A to Point B without any feel good moments.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very busy at LHR due to half term but managed a quick breakfast in the British Airways First lounge before boarding. Flight crew old style and exceptional, food and wine excellent and arrived on time. LAX was hectic but the new entry machines make it much quicker. Got through in under an hour.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Singapore, and the business class of British Airways is below the standard set by its competitors. At Heathrow terminal 5, there is no special check in counter for business class passenger. After performing the self check in, we have to join a common queue to drop our check-in bag. I spent 30 mins in the queue. The business class seat is narrower than other airlines. There is also a lack of storage space for small items such as glasses. It is relatively comfortable to sit and sleep on, but business class travel is about a total experience and British Airways has a lot of catching up to do.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "In the last couple of years, British Airways has been refurbishing aircrafts nad has minimized the leg space to ridiculous levels. This, not only for economy, but also in Business class. It is unfair to ask a Business class passenger to sit so uncomfortably when they pay double the price of economy. In addition, they have this policy for 2 bags, but one going under the seat in front of the passenger - this applies even to Business Class!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "San Diego to Heathrow. Check-in, security and boarding were all with minimum delay. Cabin crew efficient and friendly. Food quality wasn't great, nothing like food served a few years ago and their amenity bag really isn't worth having. Having said that, we had a pleasant flight as crew made up for disappointing food. We even managed several hours sleep which is always a bonus.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having originally booked in to fly Economy it was a nice surprise to see we had been upgraded to Premium Economy. The seats were large and reclined quite a lot. The food was delicious. Entertainment was the same and offered a good standard of films and tv series. However, having seen the little difference between economy and premium economy, we don't think we would be prepared to pay the difference.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew British Airways World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) on the flight from Vancouver to London. The male steward responsible for our section of the aircraft was indifferent to passengers, during the night section of the flight, he spilt a drink over my wife, made no attempt to clean up the resulting spill, and when he returned to our area he casually commented, \"Did I spill something on you\", my wife replied, \"Yes you did and I hope it was water\", \"No\", he replied, \" It was juice\" and walked away. The inflight entertainment was limited and subject to repeatedly breaking down, the food was indifferent and the snack we received before landing at Heathrow consisted of a dry croissant, no butter some jam and a half a cup of tea. I have not travelled with British Airways for a number of years due to previous bad experiences where the passenger is made to feel like an inconvenience, I hoped they would have learnt and improved, this certainly was not the case on this flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked through Iberia a year before departure with the addition of a connection to Las Palmas, online check in completed 24 hours in advance which is when I noticed that yet again BA had subbed the Boeing 767 on this service to an A320. The leg room in this 0730 departure from LHR was good with the new seating offering a more comfortable ride than Iberia Express. Food was a cold breakfast croissant which wasn't too bad once it had come up to cabin temperature. Cabin crew weren't the friendliest bunch. If you have a connection at Madrid Barajas Airport leave at least two hours - the place is huge with very confusing signposts and for some reason if you connect T4S to a T4 departure you have to go through Security, but if you do a T4 to T4S connection there's no additional security.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways is clearly cost cutting now and I wonder whether they just want to sell off their shorthaul operation. The A319 to and from Bologna had new seating which was one of the smallest and most uncomfortable seats I have experienced. The crew were ok but looked bored, indifferent and just really could not be bothered with passengers. Then came the complimentary food and drink which included half a cup of luke warm tea. Hats off to British Airways for pushing passengers towards low cost carriers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Just arrived back in UK on British Airways after a stay in Las Vegas. On outbound flight, the chicken dinner ran out at the next row to me, alternative was Spinach pasta! I declined. On return journey earlier today, the breakfast consisting of bacon and  sausage ran out one row from us! Had to endure veggie option of hash brown, tomato, mushrooms. For some reason they serve from front and rear, and by the time they meet around the low 40 rows, you don`t get a choice! Surely in the days of computers checking everything, they would know the ratio of meals that passengers are choosing. TV screens did not work for entire flight, steward even advised London were re-setting it remotely from ground!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Trip got off to a disappointing start with the British Airways lounge crammed to the rafters. We struggled to find a seat. Breakfast choice was okay, nothing exciting. The second lounge below floor has long been closed and shows no sign of re-opening. Classic BA thinking regular flyers wont notice - but we do! The furniture, seats etc are long overdue for replacement. All very tatty. The plane was quite new, clean, but had the old Club Europe seats which is neither here or there. We were in 1A and 1C and had decent leg room. Took off 40 minutes late due to delays at Pisa - and some runway modifications (or so we were told). Inflight service was strange; food first then the drinks. The brunch was a nice salad and some fruit. The two crew members looked and sounded bored. One, I don't think, knew how to smile. Then we got stacked over the Mediterranean for twenty minutes \"due to runway modifications\". We landed (unusually) from the East and I have to say it was a rather spectacular \"U-turn\" landing which (as an aviation enthusiast) I rather enjoyed. We were parked on the tarmac like a Ryanair flight. We used to have an airbridge when flying British Airways - which justified in part the higher costs. Now we don't - another obvious cost cutting exercise by the accountants at British Airways HQ. Bags delivered within minutes which given we were one of 2 planes on the ground was to be expected.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Kuala Lumpur on British Airways Boeing 777. Outbound in First, return in Club World (business class). Flights on time both ways.

      "Nice to Las Vegas via Heathrow. Overall British Airways premium economy is a good product, seat is great day seat but not really good to sleep in. Food was average, not sure why they insist on beef and then overcook. Service on the way was terrific, on the way back was average - the stewardess was bitter and not happy. Entertaiment needs to be updated. A separate cabin and bathroom is a plus, and the fact that you are behind first class cabin means you get off right away. All in all a good experience, but with some things that need to be fine tuned.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from London to Bahrain and return. Both flights on a very old Boeing 777, apparently there are only a few of these left. Advantage is that the seats are still 3-3-3 and not 3-4-3. Both flights on time. Outbound flight very full, cabin crew worked hard but without much enthusiasm. Meal was very poor, the so-called dinner was chicken in a slimy gravy. There was no sign of either fresh fruit or vegetables. Later a cardboard box was issued containing a chicken sandwich. Return flight food was even worse, but as departure was 1.30 am the initial effort, called a \"snack\", was again in a cardboard box, and contained nuts, dry biscuits and a couple of minibars of chocolate. Later in the flight \"breakfast\" was served. The choice was mixed grill with chicken or omelette. The mixed grill turned out to be an amorphous yellow mass-presumably pretending to be egg, with a round coin shaped structure which was so-called chicken and four potato discs. It was a disgrace and inedible. British Airways has to do something about its catering, it compares very poorly with other airlines. If the food is not worth eating then they should not serve it.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The first class lounge at Heathrow was reasonably quiet. Great choice of beverages and champagne and selection of food. Plenty of sitting options, light, magazines and newspapers. Very impressed with champagne and the gin bars. After years of traveling with British Airways still I have not managed to secure a treatment in the Elemis spa even when I travel first (staff at the elemis reception rather rude). Boarding on time and by priority. Window seat in the last row of the club world cabin on the upper deck of A380 with aisle access. Staff polite. The service was good. Good selection of food and beverages and wines. Wide range of entertainment. Seat comfortable and private by using the divider. The amenity kit adequate. Arrival was on time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was the first time we had traveled long haul with British Airways. The ground staff at terminal 5 were helpful and friendly. The aircraft cabin was the biggest disappointment, it hadn't been updated since the plane entered service. The inflight entertainment screen was tiny and unclear, film selection was good. The food was okay and flight was on-time. If British airways are running a new plane on your route, its likely okay, but if it is one of their Boeing 777's (old planes), I would consider other airlines.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Our British Airways flight from Helsinki to London had issues with it's brakes so the departure was delaytd. Original departure time was at 17.15, there were next info at 18.30, 19.00, 19.30 and 20.45. The captain gave us an announcement of situation at the gate around at 19.00. Meal vouchers were give at 20.00 for those who were still at the gate. Then after 21.00 an announcement to get luggage and hotel vouchers from the arrival hall. Next information will be given next morning at 09.00, which later was postponed until 14.30. Requests of rebookings were refused as the flight were not cancelled. They just said come to the airport early enough. British Airways failed to provide information about EU passanger's rights as it had to be requested separately. Lot of fellow passsengers were not aware of their rights. Next afternoon local grond handling company only had regular number of check-in desks open even there were two flights cheking-in at the same time. So only three desks open and they were not able to start checking us in but requesting us to step aside for the same day flight passengers. Great as we had only been waiting around 22hrs for our flights. Finally our flight got new departure time which was at 17.30, later to changed 18.00. At the gate departure time came and went and no announcement were made. Departure time were postponed until 18.30 with no announcement of reason for new delay. When requesting some futher information it was said it's the same reason as yesterday but we had been given a written statement saying this aircraft had been fixed. At 18.30 still no announcement and passengers get anxious about mimimal information given by aviator. Then 20 min later British Airways cancels this flight. Now rebookings promised by next morning or then have to contact British Airways directly. Another hotel night at the airport hotel and we already knew how the procedure goes. Next day rebooked for Finnair flight to London and arriving London 45 hrs late and reaching the final destination about 46hrs late. The only positive aspect was cockpit and cabin crew effort to provide some information at the gate area at the beginning of whole ordeal.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways 3-class Boeing 777-200 is used on this flight to Bangkok. I was seated in 26D which is a bulkhead seat on the aisle, behind the Premium Economy cabin. I like the fact that BA still have 3-3-3 seat layout on the B777 in economy while many airlines are using 3x4x3 lay out. I had plenty of legroom and on this particular flight I had the best sleep. Meals were average, certainly not bad. Cabin crew kind and professional. All in all a pleasant flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Glasgow to Bangkok via Heathrow. GLA to LHR flight great, clean plane, staff friendly. Business lounge in Glasgow was most enjoyable. Heathrow to Bangkok in premium economy (economy class looked very cramped), the plane was really scruffy and my foot rest stuck. British Airways have let the standard slip on the smartness of the cabin interior - the curtain from Businees to Premium Econemy was all ripped, very scruffy bad impression. Excellent staff, food also good. Flights on time. But British Airways Premium Economy is not a patch on EVA Air. BA need to upgrade planes on this route or lose customers to the other carriers. Even the staff uniforms looked washed out.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Fuerteventura to Gatwick in a refurbished A320, with the new style seats, having flown out earlier on a A319 with the old seating. Nothing much to choose between the two, but slightly preferred the older style. Not sure why they have the central seat converted to tray space and would prefer a wider seat and smaller tray space! Legroom could also be better. Both flights were comfortable and landed ahead of schedule. No lounge available at Fuerteventura which is a shame. Inflight service excellent, food for short-haul was good.  If only BA could have given us a couple of inches of extra legroom.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Dublin to Las Vegas via London Heathrow, then returning Miami to Newcastle. I've been a staunch fan of British Airways over the years but am starting to feel like they're not really that bothered about international Economy passengers. Service is just okay and certainly doesn't feel personable as it once used to, whereas domestically it is still good. British Airways Boeing 747's are old and feel and look that way too. Food from the UK is not bad but from the USA is just inedible. They really need to sort this out. Inflight entertainment is old in comparison to other airlines. I will be considering other airlines when I go to the USA now!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways have just moved Cape Town flights to Terminal 3 at Heathrow and it's not a good move. The Concorde lounge at T3 is looking so shabby that it's a disgrace. Thankfully, on board in the new first class was better. The crew was young but did a good job. Seats 4E/F are good for a couple, but there's some lack of privacy. Dinner was excellent, which is down to steam ovens British Airways have finally fitted in first class galley. The combination of PJs, duvet and a 6 ft 6 flat bed meant that sleep actually occurred. The letdown was the breakfast which was mediocre as usual, although it was good tea and coffee. But, as others have said, British Airways first class just isn't as good as Singapore and Emirates.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Awful customer service. My wife and I have flown with British Airways for almost 30 years, I booked a flight through the Executive club, which we are members of, nine months before travelling. Less than 4 weeks later we realised we would need to cancel, and after almost 1 hour on the phone on hold I decided to hang up and do it online. This seemed to be a simple process with a final message of \"we are processing your request\".  After no confirmation at all, I received my credit card statement to find a refund from BA of under £250 - my booking was over £2500. After a call to customer services I was I will not get any further refund or be able to reinstate the flights. There was nobody else to talk to, and if I emailed any of the BA executives it would be forwarded to customer services and they would not reply! I asked about ombudsman or arbitrators and was informed that British Airways does not adhere to or listen to outside bodies. Over £2100 down the pan months before take off, so plenty of time for BA to double their money on my seats. Never again!: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Roundtrip with British Airways from Bangkok to London in Club World. Really the only good thing to talk about is the baggage allowance. The seats are horrid. Cramped and you feel like you're in a coffin if you have the backward-facing window seats. It's unbelievably cramped and when I pay more than 4x the economy ticket, I expect a place to keep a water bottle when the seat is in bed-mode. The main meal outbound was not heated and had to be returned.  The pre-ordered beef on the inbound was dry. Changed it for the cold King prawn salad with couscous only to be told it was actually chicken. The bathrooms are hideous and there's no distinction between economy and business. Blocked washbasin, tissue fibres all over the place, stained walls and peeling finishes. Crew outbound were older and very pleasant. Inbound was a much younger crew and only one (Spanish lady) was truly aware of passenger needs. The rest were more intent on getting to Bangkok to party than to serve passengers with a smile. Boarding at LHR they were all in the galley blocking access to the other side of the cabin, chattering to each other and not one welcome or eye-contact after entering the door. The Club Word lounge meal offerings at T5 were abysmal. More like a school canteen. If anyone from BA reads these opinions, then please do something about your dreadful IFE. It's archaic and that's being polite. Fuzzy, small screens and if you choose a movie with subtitles, they're illegible.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was the return leg of our British Airways flight on BA056 from Johannesburg to London Heathrow on 18th January. While the majority of staff onboard where courteous and friendly, it was the behaviour of one individual within the crew who was serving my husband that left us both feeling extremely incensed that we had paid a lot of money to basically be served by a moody, petulant crew member. She is blatantly in the wrong job because she had zero customer service skills and treated us as if we were a major inconvenience to her. British Airways may have some great crew who go out of their way to make your flight a positive, enjoyable experience, but if you are unfortunate enough to experience the above negative behaviour, this makes you anti booking future flights with this company. Is this really the way BA wants its customers to feel? Being a member of cabin crew requires a range of skills - if you present yourself as a friendly, amiable part of the team giving your passengers a great flight surely you can walk away knowing you have fulfilled your part, instead of putting so much energy into giving so little. After all, isn't it us, the customers, who choose to fly with you and support you as an airline. Check in crew at Johannesburg could also do with training on manners and smiling - instead of zero greeting, no \"thank you's\" and blank faces.: 1 occurrences\n",

Although the flights were full, the cabin crew were efficient, friendly and professional. I flew World Traveller Plus on the international legs, and was more than happy with the space, choice of in-flight entertainment and the food. When I headed out to the galley to grab a single-malt scotch mid-way through the flight to UK, no problems at all. On the return flight, I had the best fillet of beef I have ever been given in an aircraft, and the red wine served with it complemented it nicely. All aircraft were in good shape: the announcements from the flight deck kept us informed, and the flights and landings were smooth. The transit through Heathrow Terminal 5 was hassle-free (although I did deliberately choose to fly on Sunday both ways), and my bags made it through with me (although the connecting time on the return flight was reduced to just over an hour because of the late arrival of the domestic flight). One of the best sets of flights I have ever experienced: in fact, I have written to BA to thank all the crews involved.: 1 occurrences\n",

On the way out from London the food was very good - why so bad from Vancouver? On the way out thre were trim bits loose inside the cabin giving the impression of bad care. I don't think the extra fare for premium economy is justified unless reasonable food is provided in both directions.

My family and I have been fortunate to fly with other major airlines and never experienced anything like this.

We would not recommend BA to anyone, and felt so strongly about the lack of service, we felt compelled to write this blog.: 1 occurrences\n",

We subsequently found that the ILS has not been working for some time and will not be working for a good while yet. Fog is common at Pisa in the winter. We could understand a last minute diversion because of unexpected factors. However, there have been frequent diversions yet British Airways gave no advance warning that there might be trouble. We had a long wait at a deserted Genoa airport and no British Airways or other staff were on hand to assist or offer drink or food. Eventually one lady appeared to show us to a bus which took us on a 3 hour journey to Pisa. We had a 12 hour day with little to eat or drink. Our chief complaint is that with advance warning from BA we would have bought water and food if we had known what could happen. In any event, BA should have done more to provide extra refreshments.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight from London Heathrow to Glasgow. Shabby cabin, lacklustre cabin crew, flight deck crew whose announcements were mainly less than informative. A crew which appeared to be going through the motions with little enthusiasm and as little engagement with passengers as possible. Some time after the cabin crew had closed all of them, the overhead locker above my seat fell open before the plane even moved off stand at LHR. On descent into GLA it opened again and hung open for several minutes and I was tempted to unclip and close it. I made the passenger across the aisle aware in case the bags fell out on top of him. Eventually, the cabin crew member whose jump seat faced up that aisle got up and closed it. We should have been sitting upfront given our ticket class (part of a longer trip), but, after service issues with BA and a long journey prior to this flight, we couldn't be bothered pointing that out. Just another shabby experience to add to the other disappointments with regard to service and lounge provided by BA on a long return trip involving two other airlines, who were streets ahead in all ways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Malta to Gatwick. I have gripes about British Airways pre-flight charges (I had to pay £30 for checked baggage and £21 to change seats), but in my case the total cost of the flight was only slightly higher than an equivalent Ryanair flight, and the difference in comfort and service is worth the extra cost. Cabin was clean and the new slimline seats were quite comfortable. Crew was upbeat and polite, and served a snack and a well-packed lunchbox. I wish BA would offer inflight wifi and power outlets, but if all BA flights are this good and only a bit more expensive than Ryanair/easyjet I will fly with them more often.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Johannesburg to Dublin via London after Christmas. Was excited as on British Airways A380. What a disappointing flight. The service was terrible, very young and inexperienced cabin crew. Had to wait ages for them to answer my bell when I rang it. Food was awful, my partner didn't get a bread roll or milk with dinner. Seats are bigger in this plane but still uncomfortable. The worst of all is the luggage allowance. 23kg! Other airlines allow 30kg in Economy. What a performance from the airline when we were 3kg over. Also having to pay for seats if you want to book them is disgusting. I will never use British Airways again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was my first time on British Airways flying from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia via London. The seats were as comfortable as economy class can be expected to be, though I would've liked the headphone jack to be on the front of the armrest rather than on the inside (which led to the jack on my headphones getting bent and ruined). Food was pretty good. The best part of my British Airways experience was the AVOD system. Flights were on time except for the expected delays at Heathrow. My only major complaint is the taxes and fees that British Airways charges even with award tickets - it almost negates the benefit of using an award ticket. All told, British Airways is better than U.S. airlines, but not at the level of Iberia (which I flew on my way to Tel Aviv) and probably well below Emirates, Singapore and the world's best airlines.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My family and I had a very good experience travelling from Nice to Montreal via London Heathrow. Both flights landed before schedule and staff was very helpful in both flights. Meal quality was better than expected and we were given seats with enough leg room, which appreciated because we were travelling with an infant too young for a seat.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bangkok to London with British Airways on 3rd January. This was most probably the worst flight I've had in 15 years. The crew were very poor, only seeing them when serving meals. No one came round with drinks or snacks during a 13 hour flight, if you wanted anything you had to go to the galley - and then they were unhelpful, I was only offered a bag of crisp! The seat was very narrow and the remote for the entertainment was on top of the armrest. Food was below the the standard I would expect from a national airline, small portions. Main meal and a pice of cake. No offer for a second cup of coffee. Overall a most unpleasant experience, I would not recommend British Airways to anyone.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My partner and I traveled British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana on 29th December. After checking in online and paying an extra £45 each way per person to reserve seats after already paying over £4000 for our flights (wasn't a major issue and was expected), we discovered that selecting our outgoing seats was fine, but our return seats had only 2 seats left both on opposite sides of the cabin. Being a nervous flyer I was not up for sitting by myself for nearly 9 hours so we decided to try to discuss the issue at our baggage drop off point, the gentleman working behind the drop off was as helpful as he could be, but basically said that we would have to raise the issue when we left Punta Cana, and that it wasn't likely for us to be able to do anything because remaining seats would be left for business and first class travellers. Getting onto the plane we were the first ones to be called up to board before economy which was good but getting onto the aircraft we discovered an extremely dated plane, with tv screens the size of my iPhone and worn tatty seats with not as much leg room as other airlines we have flown premium economy. After take off we were given a meal with the only option being chicken or beef which was okay, flight attendants then offered us drinks - once we had our drinks gave us at the same time two bottles of sparkling wine which we hadn't asked for and we were happy with, and thought that perhaps the service would make up for the dated flight. But then 5 hours into the flight we had seen absolutely no staff whatsoever and had soon discovered from overheard conversations that a lot of the onboard staff's family were on board and they were all staying in Punta Cana for 5 days before flying home. One member of staff appeared around 6 hours into the flight and gave their families and friends champagne from first class - and walked past everybody else. My partner then asked a staff member for 2 glasses of water and we were told we would have to walk to the back of the economy cabin to get them. When we arrived at the back of the crowded economy cabin we discovered several staff fast asleep and had to wake somebody for water. 1 hour before descending we were given tea and coffee and sandwiches which were fine. All staff in our cabin looked half asleep, with hair all over the place. Considering this was a 2pm flight you'd have thought it was an evening flight. We arrived in Punta Cana at 7pm extremely disapointed with the poor service and the dated plane we had endured for almost 9 hours.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Johannesburg return with British Airways. This was my first ever long haul flight to see my daughter get married in Zimbabwe. I was in for a big shock and not a nice one. The seats and room were not really any different to low cost airlines and this was an 11 hour flight - jammed in like sardines and got no sleep. Freezing cold aircon all the way back from Johannesburg, and again so cramped that when the person in front of you puts the seat back, you cannot eat your food. I used a connecting flight to Bulawayo which was with South African Airlink and even though it was only a 1 hour flight, the food was much better and the plane far more comfortable. A very poor experience with British Airways and GBP 4000 spent for the 3 of us to get there and back. I will never be disapointed with Ryanair or easyjet again. British Airways  are trading on their name only.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I usually fly on Asian airlines (ANA, EVA, Korean, Asiana) and accustomed to their very good service and food. This was my first flight on British Airways from Vancouver to Lisbon via London. I selected it because of price. Overall experience was adequate. Plane was an older B747 and interior showed its age. IFE was outdated. Seat comfort was fine. Cabin crew not attentive between meals. Western food offerings just ok. Had several hours layover at Heathrow. British Airways ground staff good and pleasant. I might fly British Airways again if equipment is updated to A380 or Boeing 787 and price is lowest to Europe.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Venice with British Airways. The plane was clean, crew good and reasonably on time, with good check in. But the flight was made unpleasant by BA encouraging people to take so much cabin baggage on to the plane. The return flight was perhaps 80% full, but the overhead lockers were full. It causes a scrum at boarding. The back row passengers board first and stowed their cases at the front so they don't have to carry them down the plane. The lockers are than full when the forward rows boarded they had nowhere to stow theirs. It was then chaos while the cabin crew sorted it out. It should be every passengers right to not have luggage under their feet.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Round trip London to Luanda in British Airways business class (Club World). It's really below average. British Airways seems stand still in the competition with other airlines. The seats are cramped. There are no storage for personal items. The seats and toilets were not adequately cleaned up after previous flight. The food and IFE were average for business class. British Airways should think about improving the cabin in general or otherwise they will continue to fall behind their competitors. Even American Airlines and Iberia, which practically owned by same company, have improved a lot. The only positive thing was the FAs in both legs were polite and courteous. They were relatively young so they still have motivation to do their jobs.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Not impressed with British Airways at all. We flew back from Denver after visiting family. We flew out with Lufthansa as they were the cheapest as we usualy fly to the Middle/Far east with them and know the standards and quality they have to offer. Our return Lufthansa flight home was cancelled due to flight attendant strikes at Lufthansa. We were booked straight on to the BA flight back to London which left only an hour later. Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied \"some sort of curry thing\" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally. I hope this review was helpful - obviously I am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with British Airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I'm starting to go with British Airways less and less. I must warn you about BA's picky prices, which jump suddenly with no explainable reason. For example, an LAX flight I was looking at went from £200 per person per way, to £450 per person per way, in just one day! My last trip with them (Jersey to Miami) wasn't very good. Service at Jersey Airport and London Gatwick Airport was great, but the plane wasn't so good. The seats are quite uncomfortable, food is a bit disgusting, inflight entertainment is absolute rubbish, and the in are just outdated and need replacing/refurbishing. The worst part was as Miami, where the 'Express' Bag Drop only lane turned out to be slower than the Check in and Bag drop lane, and even that was slow. Worse, the staff were rude and honestly couldn't care less. Sad as this airline is meant to represent Britain in a way.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Toronto to Rome via London, and have no complaint with our flights or crew which were excellent. But when we arrived in Rome, my opinion of British Airways was formed. None of the passenger baggage arrived in Rome and we were all left in the dark. When no baggage came down, we all got into the baggage handler lineup, Avia, and wasted time filling out a form. We were given a phone number for British Airways but it was out of service. Calls to Avia went unanswered. We finally went outto the airport, 2 days later, and found our baggage in an unsecured location. We werd never informed by British Airways if and when we would receive our baggage. We did receive compensation for the clothing and toiletries we had to buy but not fod the expense of getting out to the airport. This has soured our opinion of British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways introduced its new Club Europe business class which is basically economy class, minus the middle seat. Leg room is same as in economy. When I asked flight crew what's new about it, she indicated with her hands that the seats were more cramped now. It is a shame that British Airways has fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading its business product, it has introduced a very poor product on Club Europe. Food was poor and so was the inflight service. If the person in front reclines, it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. I will never fly British Airways Club Europe again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Heathrow to Vancouver outbound, Toronto-Heathrow inbound, both on rather ancient Boeing 747-400. Both flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule and the fare was competitive. Check-in and bag delivery was fine at all 3 airports. The aircraft interiors were shabby at best, seats uncomfortable, IFE hopeless, food awful. Cabin crew were mixed, one or two fairly pleasant but most going about their duties in a perfunctory way. One male cabin crew member was so overweight and sweating profusely, it was astounding that he could still be allowed to fly. From the good days of quality service in the 1980's, British Airways have gradually deteriorated into a third-class carrier and can never hope to compete on customer service with the airlines from the Middle and Far East. What a shame.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Seattle with British Airways, and I was very disappointed when dinner was being served, and to my surprise they did not have my vegetarian meal onboard - but somehow they gave to others! Although I requested my special meal when I booked my flight (return) at least 5 months earlier as well as checking in online. In the end I sat while everyone else ate around me! This was a long flight, couldn't sleep and remained hungry so I didn't enjoy the experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I had not flown British Airways business class for years. Sydney to Singapore was a reward flight and I probably wouldn't pay as much as other airlines for this product, but if it was cheaper than competitors I would pick it. Seats a bit narrow but otherwise acceptable and I like the fact you can slide the table away and get out easily. Service was top notch and very surprised, had an excellent stewardess in our area. Meal service with two salads and some nice bread along with a decent main. Small snack before landing - I always feel that a bigger option should be provided on a 7 hour flight, since it is too small for you not to have to eat again when you arrive. IFE had a good selection and worked fine. I like the way they have set out the Club World cabin - it is a bit different and although crowded it is calm and professional. Obviously the seats do not compare to the best out there. If they were materially cheaper than say Singapore Airlines or Emirates then I would take it. If they want to charge a similar price then obviously the product is not the same quality.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Tokyo Haneda to Heathrow in Club World with British Airways.  My trip was on an old Boeing 777, and apart from the old product, I could not believe the dirt and wear in this cabin. Crumbs and mess around the bottom and edges of the seat, grubby marks that I presume even the Japanese cleaners could not remove. The toilet I used remained dirty throughout the flight. The meal service has been much debated, and is served (rather pushed at you) on a cheap economy style format, and quality is on a par with JAL economy class I used in August. I'm British and like to support BA, but the honest fact is that BA have slipped right down against from the competition. My journey out was from Frankfurt on Lufthansa, an airline I probably wouldn't have used a few years ago, but their business class standards are so much higher. BA cabin staff should go to Lufthansa for some training, and maybe they could lose some of their arrogant approach.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A 3 hour delay but notified by text earlier in the day so no waiting around. The problem is that British Airways Business Class Club World product and service is so old and tired that it is just very poor value and quality. The inflight entertainment is constantly faulty and breaking - they had to keep resetting it (this has happened on the last two BA Club flights I have been on), the seats are tired, it was not very clean - the lockers by the windows on the upper deck were dirty and falling apart. The food was quite good except the dessert was awful - they always seem to serve the same lemon dessert on this leg. The crew were pleasant, but the planes are too old and tired now to make this an attractive option. I look to avoid British Airways when I can for Business Class.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am BA gold primarily due to the fact that I fly with Qatar Airways as part of oneworld. Recent flight First class from Dubai to Seattle and return first class to LHR, and business class (Club) to Abu Dhabi. Crew are great in First class on the leg to Seattle. The product is tired, the call centre is useless, on hold for over 45 minutes, messed up bookings - not good enough. Crew on return over familar in first, ground crew at Heathrow looked bored. Its the Business class seat gets me this face to face at a stranger - who designed these? I would never use it again, this shutter up and down, the snottiest crew I ever came across with a steward with an attitude problem. Food shocking in club, first was good. Great wines. Overall its tired hardware, good crew except LHR-AUH on the 31st. I suggest Willie Walsh flies Qatar Airways - that's true business class and first class.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Newark to Heathrow with British Airways. Very disappointed that I paid so much money for Premium Economy, and yet so little extra above economy class. Was in row 10 on both the outgoing and incoming (night) flights. Seats were not comfortable in that they were less roomy. I understand that because of the row, both the table and screen were in the arm rests, but by the time I had used a cardigan and the blanket to pad out the arm rests (very hard on the elbows) I felt very cramped. My immediate neighbour kept messing with his seat and was eventually moved as he said it would not recline. Later I tried mine (no one behind me) and, the same, it would not recline. Breakfast was a wholemeal croissant just out of the fridge - yuk. The British Airways check in staff at Newark are so surly and miserable. Whoever made the tanoy annoucements for boarding had an accent so that I could not distinguish what she was saying. On my outgoing trip and arrival at USA customs queue I realised that I did not have the customs entry form. Seems I should have been given one to complete by the BA check-in person. I had asked the flight attendants if there were any forms to be completed and they said they would check and get back to me. Never saw them again. Am definitely going back to Virgin Atlantic where Premium Economy seats are really roomy and comfortable and the staff friendly - even the ones at Newark.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Excellent flight and no complaints even though we were delayed due fog at Gatwick. The pilot kept us briefed as to what was going on and the cabin crew looked after us. I was however dismayed by the BA agent that dealt with our check in at Venice. We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA. Once through check-in the flight experience was excellent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Return British Airways flight from Heathrow to Las Vegas. The cabin crew were very good, helpful and friendly. However, the quality of the seatback screens and the seats are very tired, and very oudated. The films and tv shows are good, however the quality of the screen is poor, compared to other airlines. The seats are also well past their serviceable life. Other airlines offer far better seats and entertainment so it is rather disappointing British Airways don't. Even other, newer, BA planes have far superior seats and VOD, to which it is shocking the difference in the service offered for economy class, there isn't even a charging port in the Boeing 747 when there is on the newer planes. At least the meals were good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Lisbon to London on 2nd November was like many other flights affected by the thick fog which forced cancellation and delays of so many flights into Heathrow. The plane was boarded at normal departure time, just in case this flight got a slot into Heathrow, and kept informed of developments by the flight deck. Since at one point it appeared likely our slot might not open up till 16.00 (scheduled at 10.20) the food and drink service was started, and cabin crew did a great job keeping a congenial atmosphere in the cabin whilst doing this. Eventually we did get a slot at 14.00 and got into Heathrow round 16.30. It was quite stressful for those passengers who had connections to make (I did make my connection that afternoon to Washington), but the stress was reduced by continuous up-to-the-minute information from the flight deck and service from cabin crew.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Philadelphia to Athens via Heathrow with British Airways. The lack of service amazed me since I have flown both first and business on many airlines. The Club World menu listed 2 Starter items, 3 Main choices, and 4 desserts. I chose the Grilled halloumi and portobello mushroom starter. If it was grilled, it must have been a long time before it was refrigerated. Not too good. The fillet was like a piece of old shoe leather. I will admit that it might be difficult to come up with a medium rare steak but this was bad. I was never give a choice of desserts but found a piece of pie on my tray along with the starter and steak. I was never offered coffee and had to stop an attendant and ask for some. I was not offered any after dinner drink. In short, the service was rushed and more like a coach class. It appeared that the attendants were trying to get rid of us and get us to sleep rather than serve us. I was very disappointed and would avoid British Airways business class. This was on the PHL to Heathrow segment on October 26. Service on the second leg to Athens was good.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "I am a bronze member of the executive club. British Airways executive club is actually worthless since it is almost impossible to use their avios. However, one of the few benefits left is the option to choose your seat for free a week before the flight, which I did. Unfortunately I found out when I tried to check in that I had been moved from the good seats I have chosen to the worst business class seats on this flight. All my efforts to get those seats back were in vain. We flew the A380 for the first time. I still strongly prefer the 747 upper deck cabin. Beside the HD screens, nothing can beat the quality of the old 747.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After flying with BA long haul for the first time on one of their newer A380s, the flight back to LHR was with their B747-400 which is my favourite aircraft along with the A340-400. Ground service at SFO was efficient. Purchased extra luggage and was still 2kg over my limit on each bag of which the check in agent was considerate enough to let me off. My guess was that the flight was not full as there was virtually no one at the check in counters. I was wrong, the gate was packed. Considering I had 3 pieces of carry on luggage, I wasn't asked to put one of them on the hold. The flight was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Boarding was smooth and efficient. Upon boarding, passengers were having trouble storing their carry on resulting in me storing mine some 4-5 rows behind. The seat is no surprise, their older product with the outdated IFE. Cabin temperature was boiling. Passengers were requesting FAs to turn it down a little which they have mid way through the flight when everyone was asleep. The seat pitch on the Boeing 747-400 is 31 inches pitch in economy class. Compared to their A380 product, the cabin felt cramped. Although the seat was comfortable itself to sit on, it just felt cramped. I had the most uncomfortable long haul flights in my entire life., the flight became more and more unbearable and wasn't able to get any sleep at all. I was constantly trying to find a comfortable position for me to have nap but it was impossible and worse when the person in front of you reclines. To make things worse, the IFE was very unreliable compared to the A380. I fly with BA frequently on European routes where their economy cabin product is negligible due to the flight times but I would try and not fly with BA's product on their B747s. Inflight meals were rather disappointing. Service was rushed and FA's showed no enthusiasm. First meal was bland roast chicken. Landing meal was an English breakfast considering we were arriving at lunch time. Overall, I would fly with BA again but I would avoid the long haul product offered on their B747-400s.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I paid for myself to get a First upgrade for my return, as the British Airways Club World seats are not great for this long trip. The new First product is excellent. The service was greatthe seats comfortable, inflight entertainment very good, and the food was well presented, with a good choice of wines. I slept well, and actually enjoyed the journey - one I do very regularly on other carriers but chose BA this time for a change. Bags were tagged as priority but in Sydney they came out after about 120 other pieces of luggage, meaning I nearly missed my onward connection to Melbourne. Staff gossip in the galleys - it's a flimsy curtain and I don't want to hear about staff boyfriend troubles, holiday plans, or crew roster. Cleanliness of the toilets is the responsibility of the staff to monitor, but in First the toilets are too cramped, and I ended up wiping the toilet floor myself with tissues and sanitary wipes because I didn't know what that liquid on the floor was. While safety and the journey are the most important things, it's these \"Attention to detail\" items that make or break the service experience. BA ground crew, ticketing agents, cabin crew, pilots are commendable, but British Airways needs to help them to get the service right.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We paid for World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) for our British Airways flight to London. Aircraft was a Boeing 777, excellent plane. Cabin crew, very efficient and friendly. Seats and legroom, very good. What I find lacking to make World Traveller Plus worth the money is no priority check-in or security, no priority boarding for WTP passengers. In fact WTP passengers were the very last to board? Even United, Delta and American offer priority check-in and boarding. I contacted British Airways to inquire why and the reply was the usual corporate speak \"We're very sorry you were disappointed, blah,blah,blah.\" Okay British Airways, you could care less.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My issue is the very poor British Airways customer relations service you receive once there is an issue, it is only then you see what BA really is. Following a dreadful experience trying to sort out a weekend in Paris I decided to complain to British Airways customer relations, that was the start of a nightmare and frustrating experience. BA customer service is like the Fawlty Towers of customer services! I have tried many times ringing, longest on hold before I hung up was 2hrs,  fastest through 45 mins. They only want to get you off the phone as quick as they can and keep apologising that they are so busy! I have emailed them and had 5 generic emails back no resolution, worst is they are from 5 different people who clearly have not read the notes from previous emails, I have had two phone calls following tweets - all they tried to do was sell me something and had no idea that I was trying to complain. They said they would get customer services to call me, but guess what, no call!: 1 occurrences\n",

Cabin crew always friendly and helpful and food good. I am a vegetarian so can not comment on the normal food served. Planes on the Cape Town route a bit dated now but does the job well. Well done for being a star airline. Looking forward to many more hours in the air with BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The A380 is a splendid aircraft with a great passenger experience. I chose to fly MEL-LHR via HKG so I could try British Airways  new A380. I was so disappointed to see that they have used the old \"Backwards / Forwards\" layout for Club World on this new aircraft type. I remember using this seat type back in 2002, but it is now tired and lacklustre when compared to other airlines. A brand new plane, and tired old seat design. It felt as though we were being packed in so that British Airways can max out the revenue. The whole thing was a bit claustrophobic. The service was okay but not outstanding, the food was good and the wine choice excellent. Ground crew in HKG were pretty average, but in London were helpful.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Las Vegas to London Heathrow with British Airways. What we were expecting and what we got are two separate things.  We boarded the aircraft on time, and were greeted at the doorway, but once inside, the cabin crew were more interested in themselves and chatting - no help anywhere! We settled into our seats, which were narrow and very cramped, and the heat in the cabin was very uncomfortable to the point that the majority of the passengers were fanning themselves down with safety cards. The service commenced once the flight was underway and free drinks were offered, and if you fancied a beer the only choice was lager or lite lager. The meal commenced shortly after and my wife had ordered a lactose free meal which she was given - or so she thought until she looked closely and everything contained dairy products. This was changed when it was brought to the attention the of the crew, and looking back I think she would have been better with the wrong choice that was given, and suffered the consequences as it looked unappetising, bland and who knows what it was. No vegetables, no meat. The rest of the meals were served (or should I say thrown at us) offering pasta or chicken. The attitude from the cabin crew was very poor and some were rude and arrogant. For the majority of the flight the cabin crew were invisible. One  of the screens in the seatback wasn't working so this was rectified 30 minutes after the cabin crew being told - why aren't these things checked prior to boarding? The space you get in economy is abysmal, the person in front of me put his seat back and was nearly lying on me, the leg room is shocking and the seats uncomfortable. My son couldn't eat his meal until the person in front put the seat up as he couldn't see it. The cabin crew should make an announcement when meals are served for passengers to upright the seats out of courtesy to the people behind or tell people when they're serving meals - no they don't, as it would be too much of an effort for them. The only good thing about the flight was arriving early so we could get off it. Would we fly British Airways again - on this experience no, you would have more room in a tin of sardines! British Airways need to get their finger out and start offering a quality service to everybody on the flight - not just the passengers in the posh seats, and maybe send some of the staff on a customer care course.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Early morning flight from Stockholm to Heathrow on Sep 20th. Sat in the first row which had a little bit more legroom, but compared with the older Club Europe seats, not very comfortable. The purser seemed to have had a relly bad night sleep in Stockholm being really rude and unfriendly to customers, but laughing loudly with his fellow FA's. He kept on slamming the doors in the galley loudly throughout the flight. My friend who flew business class for first time was shocked. Fortunately our late evening return flight was a totally different story with an extremely attentive male purser who was there all the flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways Boeing 747-400 was a bit long in the tooth, with old style Club World seat, old video system, audio jack loose and needed constant fiddling to keep sound coming through both ears. The isolation of the window seat in BA Club World is a double-edged sword : privacy is great but cabin crew tend to forget you - on this flight, I did not receive a hot towel or an offer of a second drink, though everyone else around me did. All said and done, the flight was on time, food and wine were good, and I was pretty comfortable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First time to experince British Airways new shorthaul cabin on a flight from Heathrow to Gibraltar, and we were pleasantly surprised. I am 6'1 and found the leg room in the aisle seat to be fine. The seat was generally comfortable (though lumbar would be nice!), brown leather looks good and new lighting calming. Overall very good. I did look at the business class seats which are basically the same as economy, so will probably not fly business with BA shorthaul again, but will stay with economy. The staff were very professional and pleasant. You may however want to take your own packed lunch as the morsels given are not good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways First class seats are very good compared to their business class. Truly a great experience. Loving the windows, there’s a cover that can open, shade or close. The pods are quite private. 1-2-1 configuration.  Service very attentive and personal. They will address you by name the moment you walk in, escort you to your seat and supply welcome drinks, towels, etc. Food is reasonable to good. If you don’t like (parts) of the meals, you can replace from (parts) of other sets, turning it in fact into semi- a-la-carte. Return flight was over-booked. By phone and email they contacted me and with my permission I was rebooked onto 1st class SQ flight at same day at more or less the same time.  In all, it was a very pleasant experience.  The Singapore lounge does not have a 1st class section and is mixed with business class. Fare difference between business class and 1st class is not as huge as with some other airlines. Definitely recommended.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Glasgow to Cape Town via Heathrow with British Airways, and the short flight from Glasgow to Heathrow was fine, exit row seats with plenty of room, although the catering was a bit bizarre, a drink and a packet of crisps. The flight to Cape Town was however a different story. The Boeing 747-400 used was well past a major refurbishment both inside and out. The economy class seating was very squashed together with virtually no room to move, and I'm only 5'10 tall. The seat back entertainment screens must be first generation, tiny screen with a grid of lines on it, I've seen smart phones with bigger screens! The crew in our section were a bit perfunctory in their duties, apart from one female who smiled and chatted with and I quote \"her guests\" and who made the flight a bit more bearable. The food on offer was standard economy class fare, it filled a gap, just. The flight time for BA0059 is 11.5 hours, so British Airways really need to improve the inflight quality of their long haul flights in terms of a bit more room, and better catering for economy class passengers, who do make up the majority of people on board, not the premium passengers. The old British Airways corporate slogan \"The Worlds Favourite Airline\" are long gone. For our next flight to South Africa or elsewhere, I think it will be back to KLM for us.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have flown business class long haul on Emirates, Qatar Airways, Air France, KLM, American, Singapore, Thai Airways, Cathay Pacific and most recently British Airways for work within the last 24 months. I fly long haul 8-10 times a year so I would consider myself to be a moderate user of the service and know what I should expect for the money. I will never fly British Airways again if I can avoid it. I arrived on time and it felt like a safe journey, but everything from check in, to the seat configuration and comfort (and cleanliness), the food and the entertainment system were so far away from the competition. The cabin crew were snooty on the A380 out of LHR - in this example I was a silent observer to several unacceptable customer service responses. The only redeeming feature of the whole experience was the staff at the Washington Dulles lounge, the rest of BA could learn a lot in there. Very disappointing BA, its a shame your product quality is so below par. I'm proud to be British, but not when it comes to our national carrier, what a shame.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Nice and professional British Airways crew. The seat is comfortable and two usb ports and the in-seat power outlets are nice. Food was ok. In-flight entertainment system far away from Cathay. But the 3D map was cool. Overall a pleasant experience, and worth the money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways lost case by labeling my case with the wrong name and destination. Lost luggage office at Amsterdam was difficult to find, but staff were helpful. Form given with email contact address to keep you informed was  totally useless - 4 days of issuing emails each day no response. Phone number called by Viking concierge for 10 hours on and off for 4 days was totally ignored or information totally useless. Finally after obtaining a senior executive email address they found and sent after discussion to my house but not on the day agreed. Taken 26 days to respond to first letter of complaint. 14 days to date and still no reply to second email of complaint. British Airways customer service is laughable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This aging British Airways Boeing 747-400 appeared well maintained. The seat was comfortable in World Traveller Plus. I was seating on the last row so no pressure of inclining the seat. Food was good and a generous bar service. Before flight took off, a cabin manager greeted everyone and was one the nicest and cheerful crew I have met.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am so upset with British Airways that I will avoid them in the future. If for any reason, you have to reschedule your trip their fees are beyond anything I've ever experienced. I booked a flight from Istanbul to Denver in Business Class and unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control, had to cancel. The flight one way was $2,900 which is a lot of money. Their \"restocking fee\" was 25%, in order for me to receive a credit of 75% of the original fare. In addition, there was a $525 penalty fee so the total penalty was $1,250! So, now I have a credit for one year with British Airways and I will have to deal with them again.  What a rip off.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked my flight to Madrid and back on British Airways. Going to Madrid was on an A321, very nice seats and comfortable. The return leg from Madrid was a Boeing 767, the aircraft is old but the seats were very spacious and comfortable. The cabin crew were fantastic in their job, you only get snack for a short haul 2 hour flight, for the price and what is offered by British Airways it's worth it. Overall both journey was excellent, departed and arrived both legs on time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Whilst I don't expect too much from economy I have to say I was very disappointed with British Airways from Gatwick to Mauritius. I chose this airline as I expected the planes to be in good condition and the room slightly better for someone of my height. Instead the seat was so worn out I could feel the frame underneath and the legroom appalling. The staff were very polite and attentive, but the food left a lot to be desired.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I recommend flying any other airline than British Airways. The fare looks reasonable until you get to where you have to buy your seat! Plus, if you have to cancel your flight (in my case a meeting was cancelled) they won't issue a voucher or a refund. I cancelled my flight six weeks in advance and they refunded $140.95 of a $1003.95 ticket! And, they won't issue a voucher. I will never fly British Airways, they are so greedy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to Cancun, and I was disappointed. British Airways economy class is incredibly standard in comparison to Singapore Airlines or even Virgin Atlantic. Entertainment was not particularly varied, food was shocking, plus the staff were abrupt and snappy. I do not fly often so sometimes I might ask questions that seem pretty obvious, but I shouldn't be shamed for that. Not flying with British Airways again, that's for sure.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Sharm el Sheikh to Gatwick. I checked in at British Airways business class counter and the agent was unprofessional and unwelcoming. All my questions involved him having to ask a colleague in the adjacent economy class check-in. I asked staff where the lounge access was located and was abruptly told there was No lounge access - despite BA stating on their website that business class passengers have access to the Royal Jordanian lounge (which I saw no sign of) so I had to use the general and expensive SSH airport facilities. Boarding was absolute mayhem with no separate call for business class or Oneworld members to board first. So I jumped on the bus to be called off and told the check-in agent had booked me in economy class row 8D, which was listed as business class at on-line check-in. After a wait of 10 minutes, a new boarding bass was issued for seat 1C, and the aircraft bus had to be called back to pick me up. Onboard things did improve and chatted with friendly crew. However the pre-boarding did not represent a premium product.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was among the several hundred passengers whose British Airways flight was canceled last night from Dallas Ft Worth to London. No status indicating canceled was put on the displays at the gate, once the decision was made. They were not updated. People were told to call 1-800-AIRWAYS for help, but were turned away by the phone system, and as a result lost their places in line. One woman had a glimmer of hope with the phone system, only to be told that because she was traveling with a baby, she had to go back and wait in line. Only 4 ticket counters were open to assist the passengers, and each passenger took over 20-30 minutes to help, on average. One couple took approximately 2 hours to be helped because they were booked to go on a cruise for their anniversary and this delay cost them their connection. They were not able to get any arrangements that would get them to their cruise for another 3 days. The couple will now miss half their cruise. No screening was performed to get people with important connecting flights (like that couple or myself) close to the front of the line. There were two other flights out to LHR that night that would have allowed me to still make my tour, but due to the disorganization of the help, I missed both, even though one was 5.5 hours after the original cancellation. It did not help that the British Airways staff blatantly allowed people to cut in line, for no reason. I was still in time to make the last flight out at 10:10pm, but a couple was allowed to cut in front of me in line and as a result by the time my new bookings were made it was too late. People were falling out of line because there was no area to rest, or provisions made for food or going to the restroom. The customers were too exhausted to stand for that long. No attempt to \"take a number\" and call people back was made for the comfort of customers. Not even water was passed out during the 6 hour waiting period. The counter staff, and how they were managed, was completely inadequate. The way British Airways handled this cancellation was atrocious! Things break, including airplanes, which is understood, but the manner in which a company recovers from such debacles says a great deal about their character. I am sorely disappointed in how this was dealt with. I will now miss the first, and arguably most anticipated, part of my tour to India, and my traveling companion (coming from Atlanta) will be there alone, which is not safe for a young, single female. This airline has cost me time, money, and most importantly safety, for myself and my friend.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gothenburg to Los Angeles via London Heathrow return with British Airways. Everything went well, and I especially like the upper deck of the A380 which feels spacious and relaxed. The seats were comfortable for a 10 hour flight. I liked the bins at the window seats as this gave me opportunity to store more than I expected. Toilets were clean throughout the flight. Crew were excellent, relaxed yet professional. Did not eat food so cannot comment on it. Drinks and snacks served on these flights. I do miss the warm wet wipes that  Lufthansa for example hand out. Inflight entertainment better than usual. I recommend the British Airways A380.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Shameful service from British Airways travelling from Heathrow to Delhi. A problem with seat I had booked and paid extra for, ground staff said they had no authority - lots of phone calls nothing achieved, suggested I spoke with crew, understanding but pretty lack luster. A few crew members just rude. Food bad, service little better, seems to be a problem with allowing passengers a basic such as water. British Airways need to be shaken out of their tauper. Most other airlines far superior. Cabin very untidy, washroom not kept supplied. Sorry to say but nothing to commend here. I will try to avoid BA in the future.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My mother's flight from London to Moscow was cancelled. While understanding that these things happen, and accepting this inconvenience, it is the customer service of British Airways that I found outrageous. First of all, British Airways would refuse to speak to me (paying customer), as they had incorrect data in the ticket purchase details - despite the fact that I had any proof they may need, and all contact details in the ticket purchase data were mine. But fair enough, there is more. They couldn't speak to my mother (she doesn't speak English, they don't speak Russian), and while I was trying to offer various options to customer service agents, time passed. By the time (several hours later) I suggested their Moscow office calls my mother to confirm her identity, it was too late - Moscow office was closed, and all was offered is for my mother to call then next day. Needless to say, she had to travel next day, and it was unacceptable option. So, At no point my mother was offered anything required by Regulations 261/2004, Articles 8, 9 and 14 - so BA appears to be in breach of those regulations. I bought a ticket for my mother with Aeroflot instead, for a flight at a similar time to that cancelled by BA, and asked BA for refund. BA in turn (and after my mother travelled to Moscow) demanded a letter of authority from her, otherwise they would refuse to speak to me. They would not, for example, call my mother in Moscow and simply ask her.  My mother sent me letter of authority, which I forwarded to the BA. Now they would speak to me, and promised refund and compensation. This was on 30th September 2015. On 20th October 2015, (20 days after - Regulations state that refund must be made within seven days) I chased this with BA. I was promised a refund and compensation again. As of today (6 November 2015), nothing was paid to me yet. Customer service responds with generic messages, themed \"We are sorry for the delay, the refund will be with you soon\". My requests are simply ignored. So, while it might be a reasonably comfortable airline when everything works well, I would encourage everyone to very seriously consider how you will be treated in an event of a delay or cancellation. In my experience, the treatment was appalling.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I would never fly British Airways on London-Istanbul-London route again. Business class seat is awful, same as economy seat, no space to work or even space for your legs, no entertainment, no TV. BA thinks they can get away with making so much profit and ripping you off. Definitely going for Turkish Airline in the future.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Geneva to Beijing via LHR. First flights on British Airways for six years - not because I was avoiding them, I just did not fly much. Used to be a big fan of BA but recent negative reviews made me a bit nervous. Well, my experiences on board the 2 flights were excellent. Cabin Services Directors on both flights were approachable, courteous and professional and team members exemplary. The boarding in Geneva was efficient, seat was comfortable for economy class and the flight departed before time. The sandwich and drinks provided were appreciated. On time arrival in Heathrow Terminal 5. The process of getting to the Beijing flight was relatively quick. The flight to Beijing was a 3 year old Boeing 777-300 series and my seat was 37A - the emergency exit seat that quite a few people have complained about because it has no window and the emergency slide box on the door limited leg room. I am 6' 3\" tall and there was more than enough space for my long legs. Bar service offered shortly after take off. The food was good (smoked salmon starter, beef/rice dish,  chocolate orange mousse). IFE was excellent (compared to the United flights I had taken to the USA earlier in the month) with a good selection of films and TV shows. During the flight, the crew came by with trays of drinks. Breakfast was a cooked breakfast with muesli starter, orange juice and a bread roll. Coffee refills were offered. The flight landed on time. I really could not fault the planes, service or food on both flights. Economy seating is cramped these days but BA seats are no worse/no better than other airlines. The return flights to Geneva a week later were just as good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from London Heathrow to Nairobi return, both trips in Club World and both exemplary in every way.

      "Have flown previously in British Airways Business Class. Flew in World Traveler economy class on this trip, with adult children on their first flight to England. Loading was chaotic. Seated middle four seat section, row 49. No air conditioning in cabin. Several of us complained about heat and lack of air flow. Did not get answer from stewardess until an hour into the flight. Took 3 hours before air conditioning kicked in. No room under the seat to store handbag. Seats appear to be smaller. When person in row in front of me reclined, I had minimal room to move or to access my purse. Little attention from cabin attendants. Told them I was getting dizzy from lack of cool air, and they allowed me to move to seat in galley where air was cooler from Business Class seats. Food served was terrible. No advance menu to choose from. No individual lighting or air. I thought it was my worst experience until immigration 2.5 hour wait in line to clear immigration / customs. Our prepaid taxi waited 90 minutes and then left. Horrible experience. The return flight was worse. Delayed 1.5 hours on the ground due to no air conditioning in Coach seating again, though First and Business had it. They brought us water in the last 30 minutes. Will never fly British Airways again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A very pleasant experience apart from the so called fast track lane that took 20 minutes. The business class lounge was very nice with a great choice of drinks and snacks for early morning departure. As a regular on the Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh route it was a breath of fresh air to have the option of a full service airline and Oneworld member. The business class seats are the same as economy class on the A320 but the middle seat blocked off worked for me, and the fare paid was very similar to easyJet flexi rates. Excellent service from take-off to landing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We were delayed going out from Heathrow to Bangkok, but were notified by British Airways before our journey to the airport. The seats were reasonably tight but being Economy I expected that, the plane was freezing both there and back, every one was given a blanket so wrap up warm. The film choice wasn't good, and don't book seats next to the toilets, seat row numbers in the 20's you will always get served last, and they do run out.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I used British Airways to Hong Kong in 2012 and remember vowing to never use them again. However, as I needed to get to New York and back quickly I had to use British Airways, and I thought they may have bucked up their ideas. The flight to NYC was on a Boeing 747 which really did need an uplift, the seats and decor was tired and the staff rude. The entertainment system was terrible and limited. On the return flight, I was on a Boeing 777 and although slightly more modern, the entertainment again was limited and the control unit didn't work. The staff were better than the previous flight. However British Airways did manage to mislay my baggage between NYC and Manchester and I received it 24hours later (battered and missing some clips and thankfully nothing broken inside). I've decided that whenever I fly eastw I'll continue using Emirates or Singapore Airlines (both of a far higher quality than British Airways) and to the USA maybe Virgin (have to be better than BA surely?). I'll never use BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Ghastly describes the British Airways experience in a single word. The new Club Europe seats are not fit for purpose at all when it comes to a 4 hour flight. It's impossible to stretch out, because there is no space and I am only 6 foot tall. It's impossible to work, because there is insufficient space and it's impossible to relax, but the new seats barely recline. This is by no stretch of the imagination a quality airline product. For anyone prepared to pay a premium, do yourself a favour and give your money to another airline.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Concord lounge was more business class then first. Boarding smooth, aircraft clean. Didn't like the seat much, B777 the seat is closer to the windows then the A800 which is more preferable for me. Crew professional, no WIFI, just repeat that no WIFI, food selection limited as they had a 'catering issue'. If I booked and paid for First Class I shouldn't have to hear they had a catering issue. I had the sampler selection without the wine coupling. The portion were small so had to ask for more food from a la carte, overall the food was not fantastic. Saving grace has to be BA cabin crew very polite and attentive.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Ended up on a 25-year-old 747, the second-oldest in BA's fleet, and boy did it show. The cabin was seriously dated and in need of a good renovation, but I guess this aircraft will be retiring any day soon. The outbound flight was on a nicely retrofitted 777 with comfortable spacious chairs and excellent, clear and larger IFE screen. The screens on this 747 were tiny and and very poor resolution by comparison. Nevertheless, the service was usual good BA standard: courteous and efficient, with decent enough food (better than in past years, when revolting soggy pasta seemed to be the norm). Despite the ancient and not-up-to-standard aircraft, the flight was pleasant enough.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We were boarded quickly but suffered a weather delay of over an hour because of localised thunderstorms. Throughout this time, the cockpit crew kept passengers updated and after about 30 mins water/juice were offered before being advised that we would soon be cleared to depart. The cabin was clean and the crew friendly and polite with apologies about the delay. Breakfast snack just ok but only a short flight. In my view BA in general do short haul well, but really need to improve their long haul product.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Terrible. Flight time is well over 2 hours. Seating is like Ryanair, but we are talking BA Club Europe. Which genius decided that 30 inch is sufficient for premium passengers? No idea what to do with my legs. It's impossible to use my laptop. This is not business class. Very uncomfortable flight, especially for the money I paid. BA - rethink!: 1 occurrences\n",

Food also was pretty good for economy.  747 is really showing her age now, though the cabin was clean, tidy and in good condition, it was old in style and very noisy.

      "Flew Club World from Gatwick to Barbados in April to connect with a cruise back to Europe. Arrived on a Norwegian flight from Stockholm at Gatwick the day before and were able to check in luggage the evening before the flight to avoid any delays, next day very quiet, efficient check-in in economy section. Missed Club World check-in. Next day very efficient priority security straight to lounge. Very crowded but found seats eventually. Ordered champagne delivered promptly but it was difficult to get a refill as staff a bit overwhelmed so fixed own G&t. Boarding on B777 efficient and shown to 2 back facing seats, basically a double bed. Glass of champagne provided as we settled in. Take off a little strange as traveling backwards but when in cruise no problem at all. Several drinks services before and during meal service. Very relaxed and very professional crew. Food mackerel pate and steak quite good but not business class in its heyday which I was privileged to enjoy. The seat was strange. Very narrow and a lot of the time you are looking into a strangers face. BA has 8 across seating, more than any other business class operating the B777 in the World. Entertainment ok. Reasonable screen but hardly World Class. Things going fine until, 3 hours from touchdown they said that champagne was finished as they had to save enough for returning passengers. What about we passengers who had paid a lot of their own money to fly Club as a special treat. We persuaded a very nice first Class CA to raid first Class to provide a glass of champagne. After that we were on our own with the Club Kitchen. What a joke. Packets of crisps and a choice of red or white.  Very poor indeed for business Class. All in all an ok flight with a very good crew but signs of penny pinching throughout. Oh dear BA, how you have deteriorated.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from Kiev to London on their Airbus 319 in Business Class. Leg room was not so good but otherwise seats comfortable. Food served was good. We departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Immigration queue in Terminal 5 was very long and slow and my bag was waiting for me once I got through. A nice flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Considering BA's fares were high to begin with and you had to purchase your seats to secure in advance we still booked on the advice of our British son in law. Plane is so large takes a long time to board and disembark. We flew Premium Economy, seats are bigger and have leg room but they're not comfortable for some reason. Flight crew was fine and professional. Inflight entertainment was fine but new movie selection was small. Cabin and seats were clean and neat. Inflight kit consisted of socks, ear plugs, mask, pen and tiny toothpaste and brush.  They offer pillows and blankets. But although the seats are wider, they weren't easy to get in and out of, and not just us a number of passengers contorted just to get out. The meals were fine, though served on a tiny tray loaded with food, the meal was pretty good. Not a lot of choices, to London, beef or pasta, from London back to LA, it was beef or fish. It was hot and there was a lot of food, a salad, small  cheese and  crackers. Roll butter and dessert but I'm not sure I'd say it was what BA's advertisement claims. It didn't feel it was a premium meal. They also served snacks but it was flashed on the overhead with no explanation of where to go to get the snacks. The entire plane was dark. The second meal was a breakfast, but not especially appealing. On the return to LA, it was a very odd casserole, rather dry and bland. The flight was smooth and arrived on time, coming back we were an hour late waiting as the pilot informed us of sixty passengers arriving late from Germany. They lost one of our suitcases enroute, we arrived on Thursday afternoon, the bag was delivered late Friday night to our hotel, no offer to help with expense of having to buy what was needed until bag was found. Not even an email or text, we finally asked the hotel who said it arrived midnight Friday, we weren't notified by BA until Saturday afternoon. We ended up spending quite a lot buying shirts, underwear and shorts to get by. If we'd known they had found the bag we wouldn't have spent the money. Poor communication on their part. Not an apology or sorry for the inconvenience. I guess they figured we should be grateful we got the bag at all. I doubt we'd fly BA again sadly I'd hoped for something special.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew Business Class to Vienna on the 28/7/15, Terminal 3 is a dismal place and the lounge reflected this. There was very poor food choices and everything was tired including the staff. The outward journey was okay, flight attendant was pleasant. I think the meal choices could be improved - these tickets are not cheap. However the return flight (31/7/15) which was in economy - also not cheap, was not good at all. The attitude of the staff was really below par. The food choice was an iced bun and a chicken/bacon bun. Seeing the choice I asked for the vegetarian option-Couscous with a few slices of pepper - all of which were tasteless.  When asked would I like a drink I replied - Bloody Mary. I should have known better, as this was the attendant who having to do a live safety demo chewed and smirked the whole way through, produced the drink without any WS. I asked if I could have some and then watched him add a good 1cm to the drink - turning the tomato juice a dark brown. BA need to remember we as the customers pay their wages.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The staff were great, food was pretty good, their seating policy is a sham. For that reason I'd never fly with BA again. I have issues with arthritis and they changed my Aisle seat to a window seat at the last moment and I had to endure no room to move for most of our flight from London to Sydney.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways Business Class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. What once made BA a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. We did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. Unfortunately BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape Town and London, but next time I will fly Emirates via Dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Had a very unpleasant experience with BA this time. They changed our family seats without warning. First time flying with two babies, booked the ticket and reserved two seats together sitting together with husband. Both babies are lap seat. Two days before the flight I called the BA service to make sure our seats and ticket are all fine and got a positive answer. On the day of boarding found out out seats are moved apart. For 12 hours flight, our family seats are arranged far apart. After more than 40 minutes standing at the counter waiting for the coordination, we could sit across the aisle when we get on the plane. No food for my 2 year old. If we are not allowed to bring food onto the plane, what do BA expect baby can eat? No help from staff with any service. When babies are crying and very restless  we didn't get any help from BA staff. When I flew with other airlines, flight attendant brought small toys to help distract and entertain baby. BA forgot to unload out stroller when we landed.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was my return flight of my trip in the USA. From Europe to the USA we had an Airbus A380 which was modern and quite enjoyable to fly. My return flight was on a Boeing 747. The aircraft was quite old with seats which weren't so comfortable but at least fully OK. The flight was good, cabin crew were friendly, sometimes  absent in the cabin and not very happy when you asked them something.  The food was OK, not gastronomic but acceptable in an economy class. We had delays of 35 minutes by landing, so the flight were quite on time, though that the longest delay was due of an engine problem. I recommend British Airways even for short flights (if you book early and fares not too high) than for longer ones. One reason more is that connections in Heathrow are easy when you have two BA flights, transfer done in 35mins.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Quick online check-in and boarding passes with the BA mobile APP. It is so easy to use and definitely helps you to get rid of those annoying loose bits of paper from your cabin bags. Manchester Airport Terminal 3 is bursting at the seams during the summer holiday mornings. There's a severe lack of seats in this terminal but despite this, the security check didn't take too long at all. The BA ground staff at Manchester seemed friendly enough and boarded strictly in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This helps stop the queuing in the aisles onboard to get to your seat. We were greeted at the aircraft door by a couple of cheerful and friendly crew. The refreshed cabin now looks very modern, welcoming and clean. The comfort of the new seats and the space on this aircraft (A321) I feel would be more than sufficient for a flight of 2-3 hours or so (I'm 5ft 11\"). With a fully loaded cabin and a flight time to Heathrow of just over 30 minutes the crew were quick into action. We were offered a hot breakfast bacon wrap, orange juice and tea or coffee, perfect for such a short flight and definitely helps set BA apart from the competition. The flight arrived into Terminal 5 a few minutes ahead of schedule and outside the UK Arrivals area less than ten minutes later.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having read many reviews on here I was somewhat sceptical about flying Club World with BA, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the comfort, service and overall experience that we enjoyed on this 13 hour flight to Kuala Lumpur. We had front row seats 10A and 10B, 10A window seat is reverse facing and 10B is an aisle forward facing seat, the seats were very comfortable and we got a solid 8 hours sleep. We were concerned that seat 10B would get disturbance from the galley and washroom which were in front of it, however, this was not the case and would recommend this seat, it also has no one stepping over you to get out of their seat, seat 10A gives good privacy if needed by raising the divider, but you do have to step over the legs of the person in seat 11B to get out, not a huge problem but sometimes difficult when dark. Very attentive and cheery cabin crew, they maintained this good level of service for the full 13hour flight. The food was just about acceptable, champagne was offered pre take off and during flight, wine selections ok. I would be happy to travel BA Club World again on this 777-200 aircraft in seats 10AB or 10JK, but I do prefer the Upper Deck on the 747, sad will be the day they retire the good old Jumbo, I'm not a lover of the new A380.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I might have been in economy for service, food and seating, 8 abreast. No room to move. If you are over 80kg or 6', you're squashed completely. WC clean with paper towels. Adequate IFE. The difference between older crew on prior sectors and young cabin crew on this flight was stark. They were polite and totally wooden. On past sectors the older crew took the time to know you and, as a frequent flyer, even say thanks for choosing BA. Hung clothes returned crushed. The dinner was the same as Jet Airways domestic economy. Breakfast at 03.30 a bit of fruit, tepid tea, pastry and egg roll served out of alfoil. Club World is like a stretched Economy with a Business Class fare.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked for our trip to Uganda, in Feb 2015 we spent £1450 for 2 return tickets, had to pay an additional £100 to reserve seats on the flights. About 2 days ago I received a text message (not a call) saying that our flight had been cancelled - left us in the dark until I had to phone their 0844 number to get transferred to a Delhi call centre, when I was told I could get a full refund they tried to only refund me for the flights and not the seats on this now, non existant flight. I had to phone back a further 2 times to get through to someone that could understand that I did want my £100 as well. In a nutshell, I will not book with British Airways again,: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew to London Gatwick in Business Class, seats were quite comfortable. Reminded me of sleeping in berth on sailboat. Food was very good and the service staff were all very nice and attentive. We had a long layover at Gatwick before flying EasyJet to Inverness. Couldn't use the BA lounge after our flight, but understand that is not the case at Heathrow. Don't know why. We used rewards to fly Club World and really enjoyed. We have flown BA long haul several times and they have earned our return business.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First leg CAI-LHR was on time, flight crew was pleasant, but the seating was very cramped and legroom almost non-existent. The second leg LHR-JFK wasn't much different with helpful crew but horrible seating space. My knees were pressed against the seat in front of me constantly and had to relieve them one at a time. It used to be a flagship carrier but now it's not much better than a budget airline. Will do my best to avoid.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Travelled in party of four with prebooked seating 4 abreast outbound, 2 abreast inbound. Cabin clean, well presented and tidy with good welcome. Not a full flight but approx 80% loading. The level of service from cabin staff was excellent. Service got underway quickly with full choice of menu and drinks available. Good, clear and short information from flight deck. Toilets were clean and tidy throughout flight. Lights dimmed two and a half hours into flight to allow rest with water rounds taking place by cabin crew. Good English breakfast served 1.5 hours out of JNB. Return flight good with attentive cabin staff and quiet cabin enabling some sleep. Food did not seem to be of such a good standard on this leg. BA on these flights provided excellent service and we were impressed. TV screens a little too small.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA is getting more like a budget airline every time I fly. I now have to pay £15 to choose a seat when I book in and then wait an unreasonable time to board. Fast track were called forward first and about 80% of the passengers went that way. When I finally got to the front I asked if all the fast track were fast track and was told \"no but we are not allowed to make them go to the general boarding queue\" so what is the point. Easyjet and Norwegian are far better than BA for short haul and any Middle East airline for long haul. Try harder BA please!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight on time, nice crew on the plane, very comfortable seat and great food. Snacks and beverages served during my 6 hour flight. The entertainment system screen was big, but with not a lot of TV shows and movies. Everything was perfect, even the arrival was great.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The booking of our flights was straightforward. However, when we have paid to sit next to each other, and paid for the opportunity to book seats in advance, you would expect the seating plan for the aircraft to clearly show where all the toilets and galleys are so that as the paying customer we would have a choice as to whether to is near them particularly on a long haul flight, on this occasion British Airways failed miserably. The plane was new and the seats were comfortable and spacious enough, not the upper deck in ecconomy. However being seated next to the toilets was not the best location, particularly as we had pre booked the seats online. The service was excellent and the staff helpful and happy to be there. The gluten free meals that we ordered were provided although the breakfast could have been more substantial especially after an 11 hour flight. All in all a stress free journey which was comfortable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Uncomfortable, serviceless, low class. I had low expectations and they weren't met. Club World has gone from leading to lagging. Cramped pods (8 seats across when others have 6), and a tired old plane. I usually fly in an aisle seat but know better on BA, so was in a window seat. The passenger next to me was repeatedly woken as food was handed over or spilt on him. After the service the polite cabin crew disappeared. Only one bottle of water all flight. The food was tasteless, overcooked and the presentation with fast food condiments reminded me of fast food chain. At the price this is the worst product in the skies. Seat was broken and IFE clunky. Being used to CX, QF, SIA, Finnair, Air Tahiti Nui, AA, Lan Chile and more, I hesitate to call it business class because it isn't.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Expected Club world got Club Europe - the same as Economy on any decent airline. Food was okay, plied with alcohol if you wanted it. Must be the oldest aircraft in the fleet. No IFE other than a 24\" screen for the cabin. Was told by the ground crew that my qualifying international cabin bag needed to be checked in, not happy. It's been on international and domestic roll aboard other than on a turboprop. My colleague had the same. Officious and uncalled for. Exactly the same cabin bags were rolled aboard 4 days later on the return flight. Seats were economy class and cramped with little recline and less pitch than economy on many airlines. Why pay for Club Europe business class when you don't get it?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I managed to switch to upstairs on the 744, so happy as it is a quiet space. Seat 64A footstool was broken, so the night was uncomfortable. We left Singapore around midnight and got into LHR at 0441hrs, so sleep was intermittent as I tried to adjust the seat to compensate. Food out of Singapore was okay but still lacking. One pleasant attendant, one grumpy. No Fast Track on landing because we got in early, so queue with coach tours. I'm stuck on British Airways this trip but won't be booking by choice again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Adult meals ran out, just sausage and potato left, no children's meals available! Return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. Scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am! They had to fly one in to Orlando all the way from Cardiff - a bad joke. No children's meals available.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very good all business class flight, only issue experienced was the slow bag delivery upon arrival in JFK. Food exceptional and service provided was good. The seats were full flat. Ipad provided for inflight entertainment, with several films, tv shows etc. A good flight albeit a little expensive.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Once British Airways review their seating facilities, I will use the airline again. The seats are so cramped and when the passenger in front decided to recline his seat that was it, no matter how much I asked him to recline back, he would not do it. Only when the food arrived did he move his seat - and to add insult to injury the food tasted vile, and ended up eating the bread roll only. I will use BA now as a last option.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew back 30 June, LGW-MCO flight delayed at Gatwick for 8 hours. Got told at 13.55 when flight was supposed to leave that there was a technical fault and they were bringing in a new aircraft from Cardiff, told to report back at 15.15 to be told that still not here and to report back later and given £10 voucher. Told we would take off at 17.15 Come 17.15 got told they needed to try and get a crew. Did not depart until after 9pm. It was our tenth wedding anniversary not one member of staff said anything (I spoke with back duty office the day before and was told they would arrange a glass of champagne inflight). Boarded aircraft which was a very old 777, no champagne, no duty free and no kids packs. My IFE had to be rebooted.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was pleased to see that British Airways now uses 'proper' gates at Terminal 3 Heathrow, compared to the previous bus boarding scrum. The boarding was organised, the crew friendly and the onboard service good. We were served a tasty ham and cheese croissant with drinks, the flight departed and arrived on time and bags arrived quickly. The seat wasn't very comfortable but all in all, very good!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was my first time with British Airways. I was disappointed in the amount of seat/leg room compared to some other airlines I've traveled with. I was also surprised that on longer European flights London to Istanbul for example which I traveled) there was no TV when the flight is as long or longer than flights in Asia from country-to-country which have TV/entertainment system. The universal entertainment system was broken too and the sound wasn't working. The service button to call an attendant was broken too. A stewardess on this particular flight from JFK to LHR (BA1511 on June 19, 2015) was so rude to my daughter. My daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. My daughter asked nicely if there was any non-dairy options and the stewardess, takes the food from my daughter’s tray and says “I guess you’re just going to have to eat that salad.” It wasn’t what she said that bothered me, it was the way she said it. She didn’t offer pretzels or non-dairy snacks or anything. This was my first experience with British Airways, and I was disappointed. It wasn’t until my flight back home that I felt a bit better. On my ride back with British Airways, not this flight in specific (from LHR to LAS), I encountered a steward who was very pleasant, polite and very professional.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "As a frequent flyer on various airlines, British Airways is by far the worst I have experienced. Substandard customer service even before the flight. My original plan was to fly from Toronto to Rome via London on July 2nd. Three tickets were purchased and confirmed in March. Two weeks before departure, an email was sent to me altering my flight from London to Rome. I called and waited on the service hotline - I was able to get myself on one flight and my parents on another. The rep refused to try to put me together with my parents. Less than 48 hours before departure my rescheduled flight was rerouted to Naples. The agent told me all extra travel expenses would be my own. On the day of departure I got my flight from Gatwick to Rome after rushing from Heathrow. I was told initially the flight was rerouted to Naples and just before departure this reverted back to a direct flight to Rome - very confusing communication. I arrived in Rome to discover my parents flight was delayed for four hours. With more BA flights arriving into the terminal, the service desk was closed before my flight even arrived. There are no BA reps anywhere to seek assistance.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Let me just start off by saying that I'm an educator, and I have the patience of a saint. This being said, after my first flight with BA when my luggage stayed in Tampa and didn't make it to the UK until four days after I'd arrived, I stayed fairly calm. Mistakes are made. My flight had been canceled (which seems like commonplace at BA), and was re-booked after only three hours on the phone. When I ventured to take my trip home, I was notified via text message that my flight had been canceled yet again. After speaking to a calm man about my horrible experience thus far, he informed me of a customer care number that I could call and complain about my flight. Let's remember I'm a teacher, and I also payed $1,800 for this trip. That's an entire months pay just so we all know. I'm meant to leave tomorrow and still have not received confirmation via email. I cannot reach BA via telephone. I've not been given proper accommodations to resolve my dissatisfaction with BA. Needless to say I will never fly BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The baggage check in took forever, it was 45-50min of standing in the queue. The flight looked good and well maintained 777. Inflight entertainment was good and updated to latest movies, documentaries, talk shows 5* for that. The seating space was just about good enough. Be careful of the head set it can get in the way and snap. The air conditioner was not up to the mark so it was warm in the cabin. The inflight food was extremely hot, in short it was burnt. The answer from the flight crew when someone asked for a second helping of 150ml coke can is that they needed to keep stock for the return flight. This was the first time in 12+yr of international travel of hearing this excuse.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight was decent. Have to say the seat was rather cramp. I'm 180cm, or 5 foot 9, sat at seat 32F. Inflight entertainment was alright, but do take note to always unplug the headset whenever you get out of your seat. It damages easily if it gets caught on something. I had to change 2 headsets because of that, because being in a aisle seat, you have to get off when someone wants to use the lavatory, thus remember to unplug it if you intend to get up from your seat. Service was alright. I requested for eye shades, and it came about 1hr later, crew must have forgotten about my request. I didn't pursue it as I thought I could just head to the back galley and request for them after my movie. In terms of food, it was appalling and greasy. Overall, I will not say never again, but given a choice, I'd look out for Singapore Airlines first, then the big 3 Gulf carriers. For the right price I'd do BA again, otherwise, there are better ways to suffer than that cramped seat: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR to KUL. Bag drop off took much longer than expected especially as we had already checked and printed our boarding passes. Full plane left about 45 mins late. Food and drink better than expected, as was cabin crew service and seat comfort. Friendly and efficient service. I suspect the plane might have seen better days given that the entertainment system was ancient - no games, small screen compared with the likes of Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. Some cost cutting evident - no menus, hot towels, metal cutlery - which is fine by me.  Would be happy to fly with them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Both flights on time, aircraft appeared to be well maintained. BA should be commended for retaining 9-abreat seating in the 777, legroom is adequate and adjustable headrest is a nice touch. AVOD was decent, with clear screen, though movie selection was not extensive. Catering was marginal on the outbound flight from Atlanta, with breakfast \"croissant\" being inedible, however, much better on the inbound flight from London. Cabin crew were professional, but utterly aloof, interacting with the passengers without the slightest hint of warmth. Not allowing seat selection until 24 hours prior to the flight (without paying extra) is a negative, in my opinion.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outbound flight to Athens was on time, but return flight delayed by almost 2 hours. Due to an equipment change the return was on a B767, and I was seated in the premium economy cabin, which was definitely more comfortable, and had the added benefit of AVOD, which is unavailable in the usual A320. I was pleasantly surprised to be served a warm meal on both sectors, which is more than I was expecting on an intra-European flight. Crew were professional, but not particularly helpful or engaging.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am a very frequent long haul traveller and although I will often choose the Asian carriers (e.g. Singapore Airlines, JAL, Cathay) over British Airways, being based in London means that I do often fly with BA. I find BA's long haul business class offering though innovative when it was launched in the 90s has now been way outclassed by many of its competitors. The seats don't quite lie flat (and it's not unusual to get a broken seat) and half the passengers have to go backwards and climb over other passengers to get out - I can't think of any other major airline that has this any more in business class. I am told by a BA contact that they considered changing the configuration for the A380s, but didn't in the end. Worst of all, I find the onboard service incredibly inconsistent - most often it's a little begrudging, occasionally it is excellent and sometimes it is downright awful. I was particularly annoyed at my customer service experience on a flight from LHR to Tokyo Haneda, when settling down in my seat, I looked down to find a dirty napkin, used earplugs and toothpick and significant quantities of broken glass around my feet (good job I hadn't taken my shoes off at this stage). My husband flagged down a member of cabin crew, who said she would come and clear it, but didn't. I flagged down the Cabin Services Director who did bring a dustpan and brush and said he would report it. Upon my return, I complained to BA. After three weeks, they deigned to reply, but it was on the lines of 'our cabins are always cleaned to the highest standards, we are sorry you didn't find this to your liking' - effectively implying that I was making a fuss over nothing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Club Europe from Istanbul to Heathrow, excellent flight with quick and easy boarding. The service was as always to a high standard with a good selection of choices for the evening meal.

      "My son and I flew British Airways from Glasgow to Paris on the 7th January and returned on the 11th. On out outward journey, the London flight was cancelled, so there was a knock on with our Paris flight. We did get to London, the staff were great at helping us transfer to the 5B terminal to get the flight to Paris. But I noticed that by the time we would get to Paris, we would have missed the last shuttle bus to Disney. I mentioned this to the crew, who were very good at helping, realising that I was travelling with a young adult with learning disabilities. During the flight, one member of crew kept me updated. THere were some BA managers onboard as passengers. Before we landed, he came back and told me that one of the managers would get us through to the taxis and explain to the driver where we were going and ask for a receipt. (My french is minimal, so I'd have been lost) The manager told me to keep our boarding passes and receipt amd claim BA for the taxi. My son and i had a great weekend, got home and a couple of days later, I claimed for a refund. Alas, the computer said a big fat no. It was just bad luck that we'd had to rebook flights I explained that it was a BA manager who told me to claim and it wouldn't take much to actually find out who flew on the flight. But still, no. Our insurance won't pay either because we didn't have a long enough delay! Ok, legally, BA may be in the right, but morally, well. Even the insurance company thought there should be a bit of leeway. After all, we were delayed due to a cancelled flight - their fault. Usually BA are brilliant when we fly with them and I cannot fault any of the frontline staff. Just that blooming computer. So I am 80 euros down on the taxi and 32 euros for a transfer I couldn't use.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Same tired plane back to London. Ground and cabin staff were friendly, pleasant and helpful. A first on this series of flights. Flew on the same plane on the way from LHR to IST (see other recent reviews). Moved to row 1 for more space. Still sub-standard and why, why put economy seats in business class? Lounge was crammed and noisy pre-flight. I joined Star Alliance as a Gold Member so at least got to see the Miles and Smiles lounge. BA, look around don't rest on last century's efforts. I've flown BA First but just wouldn't any more. Responding to Skytrax reviews may just help increase profits. I must say, apart from the cheery crew on BA 677, the polite but totally disinterested service (when it exists) and old, cramped cabins will be my memory of this business trip.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been flying between Dublin and London once every 2 weeks on average since the beginning of the year, and I have regularly used British Airways at the beginning. However, I have found their new policy of asking for £15 for seat selection (even at check-in) really annoying, unnecessary and insulting to loyal customers. Fair enough if they want to charge for pre-booking of seats, but at least they should allow selection at check-in time in line with their direct competitors on the same route (Aer Lingus). I have also found the service (food, drinks etc) extremely poor for the fare charged, even for the short sector. If they continue their money-grabbing policy I will definitely and happily give more of my business to Aer Lingus and Cityjet which operate the same route and seem to not treat their customers as infinite cash cows.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-FCO and return outbound A321 new Club Europe seating, return Boeing 767. I've not flown Club Europe for some years and wasn't looking forward to the flight due to the new seat pitch which is the same as economy. I was fortunate on both journeys to secure a seat in row 1 where you do have extra legroom. The only other seat with extra leg room is the emergency exit row. The food and drink selection was good and the service from the crew was excellent on the return leg.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "It appears BA continues to adopt a “do as little as possible” for this route, presumably due to their monopoly. The aircraft and cabin is looking tired/old, and decidedly mediocre compared to recent business class flights with Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Outward excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. My seat (2K) was shockingly filthy. It had been cleared since the last passenger, but I noticed much ingrained filth e.g. food /drink splatters on the cabin wall, crumbs in seat folds/gaps and stained cover, all sorts of debris on floor in gaps/cracks, and remarkably grimy carpet. Cabin attendant offered me choice of the empty seats, but on inspection these were in a similarly grim state. Seat was OK for comfort, but mediocre IFE choice with very poor quality screen. Meal service was good for food and drink, although dirty environment was off-putting. Lacto Veg’ meal much improved since last tried. Pantry service is underwhelming in places e.g. Mars Bars and KitKats are tragically promoted as retro, but some nice ice cream. Return in 1K, and excellent service from cabin and flight deck crew. I'm ridiculously grateful that this cabin is clean. Tired, so skipped dinner. Decided to watch a short TV programme and found much better picture quality on screen compared to outward, although even less programme choice. I found seat comfort mediocre in bed mode, but got five hours of sleep. The cabin layout is clearly designed to maximise passenger numbers without much thought for their comfort. Awake for breakfast, so when attendants were offering bacon rolls I asked for my wife and my requested Lacto Veg Meals. Staff returned ashen faced, and profusely apologising, with two neatly wrapped and labelled plain white bread rolls. Such bad service, and a lack of joined-up thinking! You couldn’t make it up. Post-flight I found the BA customer complaints dept to be dreadful, and left me far more disappointed with the service than at the end of my flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight home was as good as the flight out. Had long delay to depart, in part from a missing passenger who checked in, then disappeared - one of those mysteries about airline travel that happens from time to time.  Meanwhile a full plane of passengers were delayed in total by 90 mins. A320 was newly refurbished and clean. So called \"new\" Club Europe seats were installed, and as I was in row 1 it was okay. The menu was identical to the outbound and the beef main course was was terrific. It was the sort of meal that I would have happily paid £20 for in a quality bistro. FAs were great. The Chinese FA was the sort that understand customer service. Her colleague was closer to retirement and seemed to be on another planet most of the time. At the half way point I wanted another gin and tonic, but they had run out of both ice and proper \"glasses\". On arrival to LHR we were parked miles away from the Terminal. No reasons was given. All in all, a very good experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Once boarded there was a technical fault with air conditioning and the cabin got very hot. The cabin crew did offer cold water to keep all passengers cool, and delay was only around 20 minutes. Once airborne, drinks and snacks were served. Seating on A319 was comfortable for a short flight. At GLA Airport the parking stands  are so far away from the main terminal and pick up points, and changes to the airport in the past couple of years have increased the walking distance. This is annoying if you only have hand luggage and want a quick getaway, especially on a late night arrival. One sees Easyjet and Ryanair passengers passing through the arrivals process much quicker.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Disappointed. The food was poor, my wife's steak could have been anything, my curry had a tiny piece of chicken. The cabin was less than half full but cabin crew hadn't time to bring a glass of wine. After the meal, staff disappeared. No after dinner drink offered, no refreshments during the night. For the price this could have been a lot better. Return on old B747 was better.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This is my 3rd flight with BA in 8 months and  the worst yet. The customer service and communication is appalling. Originally my return flight was from Rome to London Gatwick but my flight was cancelled due to issues at Rome airport. But instead of BA getting in contact with me in regards to this, the third party company I booked the flights with had to. When Checking in they tried to charge me for baggage again although already paid for. When I  spoke to them on the phone, they just tried to fob me off to other numbers even though I called the Customer Service number. This is a shame because for once the actual flight and flight service was good which is surprising. But as a result of the rudeness, lack of communication and appalling customer service I'm very unlikely to ever use them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways never fails to surprise. I find the business lounge in Geneva quite reasonable and on this last occasion was impressed with the manner in which the Lounge Manager handled a cranky passenger who was accusing him of destroying her favourite newspapers. Then, once on-board, I discovered that Business Class on some of BA's European routes have a seat-pitch that almost prevents gaining entry to the window seats! For those used to flying Qantas domestic economy in Australia think of a forward seat in economy with the middle seat kept empty: and that's it! On the other hand, service and food was excellent and the flight crew commentary was superb. BA have an excellent in-flight magazine.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight was delayed 2 hours - I was given reasonable notice, but then had to rearrange my connecting flight and ended up with a lot more time at Heathrow than I would have liked. Check-in was fine, and cabin staff attentive, food average - but I do have an issue with space. The 747 fuselage tapers at the back - there's not enough room for 3-4-3 seating, and rows 51 on have 2-4-2 configuration. Rows 49/50 don't have enough room for 3-4-3 seating either, but BA do it anyway by sneakily making the outer seats narrower than the rest. I endured a 9 hour night flight in one of these horrible seats, my back was twisted and sore for weeks after. This is just not acceptable for a long-haul flight, especially at night - BA charges extra for seats identified as having more room, by the same principle these seats should be advertised as having less room and cash-back offered for anyone prepared to accept them (small children, perhaps).: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Short hop from the empty terminal 1 at LHR to LUX. Nice to be able to use the lounge in LHR, but an aggravating wait at security despite virtually no line. Excellent service on board, off the plane at LUX, through passport control and in the car in under 10 minutes. I was impressed with the cheerful nature of cabin staff.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-NCL-LHR. I was rather disappointed to learn that my early morning Sunday flight was cancelled without any reason on the afternoon before the morning I was to fly - the whole point of this trip was so I could easily go back and return the same day to attend my sisters wedding, saving time and also money due to the trains being so expensive. I managed to rearrange my flight for the previous night and while annoyed I had to now arrange last minute accommodation, I thought this would be straightforward and as far as re-booking it was via the BA app. What it didn't tell me was that the flight I re-arranged to fly out with was severely delayed and my heart sank as I received a a text/app notification telling me so - I think this was very sneaky not to mention before re-booking and I spent a couple of hours getting to know Terminal 5. The general feedback from here and from friends is flights on this particular domestic route are often subject to delays and cancellation, and for a full service airline that is simply unacceptable - more than anything when everything else is cutback, reliability becomes golden. The plane itself was immaculately maintained and clean and I liked the simple but elegant cabin. BA staff also do let things down a bit, often quite brusque and unfriendly, and the desk staff do come across rather insincere when there are issues as there was here. Cabin Crew were fine, but lack warmth of some other Airlines. Sadly there aren't any other options on this route, so will probably be switching back to rail, despite sometimes competitive fares.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This is more of a general review having travelled almost exclusively with BA longhaul as a family for the past 3-4 years. I highly rate BA for families. On our travels I have found the BA staff inflight: 1) To be sympathetic towards my wife and I with having infants. They have offered quiet areas during service (on the A380) to help settle our baby. Left us to last for dinner service if we were in the middle of settling the kids (nothing worse that being made to take a tray of food when all you want is your kids to sleep). 2) Friendly and attentive, but maintaining professionalism. Crew are not servants to passengers. They have a fairly strict roster of duties to attend to but I find that they are more than happy to help at the less peak times. They are less inclined when they have 300 people to feed. It figures. I am fortunate to regularly travel longhaul for business and so reach Silver tier on an annual basis. Having BC check-in is a great bonus for checking in a family - shorter queue etc. The greatest perk is that as Silver I get 2 bags at 32kg each. Not only that but when I travel with my family, my wife and eldest child get the same allowance as I do and our infant gets 23kg bag. Plus car seats and pram free. That is a huge allowance and makes packing less stressful. BA are a professional outfit and get you where you are going, I have no issues with them and find them value for money. I could not care less what the food is like. I fly to be on time and get good connections. Heathrow T5 is great.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR to YVR return. Hard earned Avios points trip. Had been 3 years since I last travelled Club World and not much changed. The lounge at Heathrow was very crowded. Afternoon Tea time so just sandwiches, cakes and soup available. Sandwiches were fresh and very nice. Plane as a 747 that had seen better times. The seat was clean but tired looking. The biggest let down was the screen that was blurry in comparison to the Bling Airways screen I had in economy. The main meal was really nice. Beef fillet that was tender and cooked. Side Salad full of flavour and Mediterranean starter that I wanted more of. The 2nd meal was \"afternoon tea\" of 3 finger sandwiches and a piece of chocolate rocky road. A real cream tea would have been better! Seat comfortable upright and in sleeping position. Got plenty of rest and sleep both ways. Coming back the lounge in Vancouver is above the gate. Just enough seats. Nice snacks. Another nice meal on board, spoilt by a dry bread roll. Breakfast was a big disappointment. Expecting a cooked English breakfast we got fruit in a plastic box followed by an egg and bacon muffin. I took one bight of the muffin and it mad me want to gag. Good crews on both legs. Bags came out priority so big plus to BA. As a free plus taxes and surcharges trip it was good, but BA need to improve if they want to lead the pack instead of being just average.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Club World from LHR-ORD. Busy flight on the ageing 747-400. Seats comfortable as always and a calm cabin on the Upper Deck. Only fault were the crew. They seemed just out of training school. Although very pleasant and friendly, the two made quite a few mistakes with orders and drinks and appeared nervous. Flight left and landed on: 1 occurrences\n",

      "This review refers to a return trip from India BOM-LHR in Premium Economy. The seating is fine in this class and is definitely worth the extra from standard economy in terms of the leg room. However that's where it ends. The service compared with Business which I travelled out in, is woeful. The BA cabin staff seem to treat anybody not flying in Business or First as second-class citizens and barely do their job. That and the awful food - the worst I've had on a long haul flight has made me seriously re-think my choice of carrier next time I fly the route.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This review concerns LHR-BOM in Business Class. I'm not a fan of the BA business class seating. It's very awkward to access the aisle from a window seat and also the practice of having your meals passed over a retractable divider is difficult for both the customer and the flight attendant. Having said all that, the service on board was great, the stewardess looking after my side of the cabin was chatty, friendly and couldn't do enough to help. The seat itself is OK, not overly comfortable but I did manage a few hours sleep. Food is not great on BA though.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Family of 3 - 747 out (upper deck) 777 back. Fortunate to be a silver member so get to allocate seats when booking. Flights on-time out, 1 hour delay on return, reason late inbound aircraft (really useless excuse). On departure no knowledge of which gates would be used for this and many other flights so both main lounges by security in T5 hellishly overcrowded. Assume the remote lounges would have been empty. 747 tired with ancient entertainment system but quiet upper deck, 777 the same except crowded and busy on the only deck - although both did have new first class so some upgrading had occurred, just not all of it. Crew however excellent throughout in both directions so well done, particularly return leg which had considerable number of young children making for demanding work. Food both directions actually quite decent, continual drinks service for first half of flight e/w then help yourself in galley. Good value as we gained big discounts when booking a holiday package. Had I paid full fare would have been very disappointed though, doesn't near match up to the main opposition these days - too many seats in an inconvenient layout. I do wonder if BA have given up going for the business traveller in premium classes on some long haul routes now (as they have for short haul club) and now see the higher spending families as their revenue source - maybe that's why we got the antiques to fly in.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Travelled from Venice to Gatwick on 28th May check in staff rude and unhelpful plane seats and food trays dirty and seats very worn and uncomfortable. Lady next to me had her arm rest fall off during the flight. Food for my daughter inedible. Attendants very lacklustre. Nappy changing table fell on my mum whilst on the toilet attendant suggested we sue BA! Wrote to BA to complain got fobbing off email in return. Won't be wasting my money on business class again. Shocking service and standards from start to finish.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Worst customer experience on BA flight. I have a confirmed flights for British Airways from Singapore to Sydney for tomorrow. When I tried to check online the system did not allow me to do online check-in. I called the BA contact center in the UK and was shocked with the response received. The person told me that there is a difference between confirmed booking and confirmed seating. Essentially BA wants to sell their seats at a premium. They arm twist the passengers and make lame excuses that although you have confirmed flight bookings it doesn't mean you can fly unless you get the seats allocation. We are travelling as a family but got scattered seats. Very embittered with the overall experience. Will never fly again with British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I had this terrible experience of traveling British Airways from Heathrow to Calgary. The plane was parked in a no-mans area and we were bussed to the plane. To my horror I had to climb through the stairs with my carry on bag! The width of the seat and the leg space is the smallest I saw in my 40 years of travel experience. It's a shame that that the airline is using this kind of carrier for a Transatlantic flight. The quality of food is one of the worst I have ever seen. I picked the non-veg chicken item the taste and content was hopeless. The container was marked for expiry as 28/11/16 07.53 an expiry after 18 months but marked for the hour and minute. The only positive thing I can think of in this torture for 9 hours is the attitude and service of the cabin crew they were great.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "All I can say is mediocre. Having flown this route with other airlines in business class, I believe I have been spoilt. The British Airways product is old and just adequate. TV screen small and poor quality, food okay but nothing more, seating poor. The one highlight was quality of service from the crew. I had nothing to actually complain about, but nothing to make me want to use this product again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Overall, it was good. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The seat were fairly comfortable with plenty of storage space on the sides. The food and entertainment were fine. My husband's screen would not work at first, but the flight attendant fixed it in a few minutes. The cabin was clean. One of the seats did have a broken piece of plastic where the cup holder was. It could have pinched or cut someone. We were happy with the flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Club Europe to Istanul on 767, boarding was speedy and boarding completed quickly for an on time departure. The flight was excellent and the crew in Club Europe were as always providing excellent service and professional at all times. Although the 767 is showing its age, I still prefer this aircraft to the A320's which also are used on this route, on the 767 at least the Club Europe seats are comfortable and offer plenty of leg room unlike the new Club Europe which is used on the A320's which is in reality going back to the days of charter airlines! So come on British Airways lets go back to the old configurations where we have plenty of leg room in Club Europe and reduce the rows of seats, we do not want Low Cost Airline look alikes otherwise we would fly them, we choose BA because we are loyal to you so bring back your old standards once again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA staff were excellent from the start to the finish. Service onboard was friendly, professional, and helpful. My wife left her handbag on board the plane when we arrived at Heathrow, and the BA flight attendant personally travelled from Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 to hand deliver it back to her. If you know the huge distance between terminal 3 and 5 at Heathrow, you'll know just how much effort the flight attendant put in to returning the handbag. That exceptional level of customer service is almost unheard of these days, so BA get a 100% customer care rating from my wife and I. Snacks were good given it was only a bit over 3 hours flying time. Aircraft was clean, however the only negative was the Business Class seats, in fact the tiny cramped seats was the only thing that BA should really change as it sort of killed an otherwise perfect journey. They were standard Economy Class seats cramped in tight so your knees were pressing into the seat in front. To convert these to Business Class seats all they did was put a fancy clip-in style armrest to make the row configuration 2 seats instead of 3.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA seems to be losing its ability to run an airline. I have had 4 flights canclled in the last 3 months, 3 of them while I was at the gate. Every flight which does operate is delayed. Staff attitude is appallimg, they just don't seem to care. I have no compensation. My step daughter was deinied boarding due to BA overbooking. BA then messed up her rebooked flight and then lost her luggage. No apology and no compensation. Should their slogan be \" Not to Fly, Not to Serve\"?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Previously a loyal BA customer, I Usually travel economy on shorthaul but I am 6'4\" with long legs and am very uncomfortable unless I can get Exit row. So on this flight I took advantage of a what I thought was a reasonably priced Club World ticket expecting the past 34 inch seat pitch. Horrified to find on boarding that BA have reduced the seat pitch to 30 inch - exactly the same as in economy. The presence of an empty middle seat and pathetic little table for your tablet computer is no compensation. Fortunately this was a short flight but even so I was extremely uncomfortable. Cabin staff and other passengers said there had been loads of complaints but clearly BA don't care. I sometimes go to Cyprus and the thought of a 4 hr+ flight in these cramped seats puts me off totally. The meal was passable but as the flight took off a couple of minutes before midday it was classed as \"late breakfast\" and no wine was served. It is clear that BA are putting profit over customer service and I am amazed that anyone travels Club Europe. Later in the year I was due to travel to South America via Madrid in Business Class but have now cancelled and switched to another airline. In future I will avoid BA shorthaul wherever possible.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked a hand luggage only fare at short notice so it was pricey. Allocated a decent seat but amazed at charge of €26 to change it so didn't bother. Flight seemed to be full of families split up probably for the same reason. A ripoff. Flight was late, usual excuse of late arrival from a previous flight. Flight deck crew affable. Food and drink good and free, a bonus. Cabin attendants, an older purser up front a bit patronising. The two in economy were really going through the motions, no eye contact and perfunctory service. 1 drink served in a 2.5 hour flight. For the last hour the two at the back were eating Club Europe meals which I saw them bring from the front. This was BA2591 on 22 July. Not great.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew to London Gatwick in Business Class, seats were quite comfortable. Reminded me of sleeping in berth on sailboat. Food was good and the staff were very nice and attentive. We had a long layover at Gatwick before flying easyJet to Inverness. Couldn't use the BA lounge after our flight, but understand that is not the case at Heathrow. Don't know why. We used rewards to fly Club World and enjoyed it. We have flown BA long haul several times and they have earned our return business.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I had the misfortune to travel up to Newcastle on a hand-baggage only fare which, for some reason, doesn't entitle you to choose a seat. I was allocated seat 11A which had the tightest leg-room I have experienced, luckily it was only a short 50 min flight. These fares aren't cheap and BA seem to be focussing more on extracting as much money as possible rather than providing a good service which is a real shame.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Day trip to Vienna, used BA Economy as their Business Class fares are a complete rip off on BA these days. Heathrow T3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to T2 or main BA flights out of T5. Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's. As a oneworld Emerald (not with BA!), I stick with oneworld members, but Austrian offer a much better service and quality standard than BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR to Santorini. Lounge was busy - but then it often is. Flight left about 45 minutes late and this was blamed on congestion. (I guess we are stuck with this excuse for the next 10 years until they build a 3rd runway). Plane was very clean. We were in Club Europe (new seat design) in row #1. I am glad we were as rows 2,3 etc looked very cramped. The only difference with economy being the table tray in the centre - instead of a seat. Lunch was very good indeed. I had the Thai chicken - my wife had the cheeks of beef which she said was excellent. FAs were very friendly. Smooth flight all the way. Its sort of worth the extra money I guess - the privacy and the one WC for the front end of the plane. It could however be so much better, with wider seats and doing away with the silly central \"table\".: 1 occurrences\n",

      "After flying many, many, times, I can honestly say this was the worst plane I have ever flown in. The aircraft was old and falling apart. During the flight the handle of the toilet flew off, one of the overhead bins was loose and the table holding the bassinette was broken. The carpet was threadbear and the equipment was being held together with tape. They did not have enough food, and nothing available for me (I have a nut allergy), the food that was served, was not fit for human consumption. The toilets were not cleaned during the whole flight (13 hours), and as a result the smell from there was disgusting. The rubbish bin was overflowing with waste, which included soiled nappies. The only time we saw the cabin crew was when they were serving food. They looked very scruffy, not what you would expect of a BA cabin crew. All in all a very unpleasant flight. I travel to Asia every year and will ensure I never fly BA on this route again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very good flight in Club World from start to finish. OK, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows. I fly often with the middle eastern carriers who offer newer planes and a more luxury feel, however BA scored highly on crew, seat comfort and ease of sleeping. I also visited the Heathrow T3 arrivals lounge which is first class. I will definitely fly BA club world again if the price is competitive.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Overall good experience. BA owns Vueling/Iberian airlines booked me Paris to Rome. If they try to book you on this airline say no. No leg room, no service, never again. After two weeks in Europe I was really looking forward to going home to my family. When I finally got to the BA counter in the Rome airport, I was told my flight to London was delayed. I would not be able to make my connection in London and I would have to spend the night and fly out in the morning. At another BA desk I was told they had a hotel for me within walking distance. Well I'm 70 and I would say, more like, walking distance if you're a camel. The room and hotel were fine,but when I went to the restaurant with my meal ticket, I was given a menu with three items on it, told I could have water for free but be charged for any other drink. I had paid extra to book my aisle seat months in advance but now I had to book again (BA should have done this) one day in advance of my flight, middle seat, for my 12 hours of flight home to LA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR to BKK June 13th 2015 Club World (Business). While the aircraft is starting to show its age, seats were reasonably comfortable - as long as you don't mind the unusual seating configuration where some passengers travel facing backwards. Cabin service and food quality were good - with one of the best breakfasts we have had in the air - a delicious fruit muesli followed by a 'full english' which was hot and tasty. On this overnight flight, sleep was difficult mainly due to the narrowness of the seats. BA should provide a mattress 'topper' as many other airlines offer to enhance sleep comfort. Fair value for money proposition.: 1 occurrences\n",

This crew were  helpful and went out of their way for me and my travelling companion as we were due to make a very tight connection to travel home by other means.

      "I flew from Seoul to London, business class and was surprised how much better the food was than in first. It was interesting and enjoyable and attractively presented. If only BA would abandon the bizarre seat configuration in business, it would be very good. The service was OK, if a bit inattentive, but it is embarrassing to have the attendants slide down the screen every time you need anything. You find your face inches away from that of a stranger. Fortunately, I now know which seats to pick to avoid climbing over my neighbour to reach the aisle.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew out on the 8th June 2015 and all I can say is that the staff, flight and service was excellent.

I will definitely be flying out with them again and I will recommend them. Service on the plane was excellent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I fly with this airline almost every other weekend from Abu Dhabi to Muscat. Throughout (I think so far 7 trips with them), they have never had any delays with me, and even if there has been, it would be a maximum 30 minutes (and still be able to arrive in Muscat on time). Staff are professional, yet friendly enough to chat to. It would be excellent if there was a flight from Muscat to Abu Dhabi at an earlier time (the only ones available now is one that arrives at midnight). The only downside to this airline is that the Highlife shopping is not available for that Abu Dhabi - Muscat due to the short duration, even if you booked and paid for the items online and were hoping for an onboard delivery.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check in at First counter by a scruffy guy who wouldn't check my bag through on a connection. The ground crew were ordinary on First check in (nothing special) and in the lounge. Unable to answer if there was an arrivals lounge at Changi and just not interested in passengers (sorry customer) compared with comparable Qantas products. Managed to get upstairs at the last minute on BA11 (10/7). Excellent cabin crew. Couldn't have been more different than on any other sector on this trip. Interesting and interested. They couldn't understand the lack of through bag at Singapore. Good food, clean cabin, uncomfortable and dated seat so didn't sleep much. This cabin crew probably don't go on to Sydney. Shame because they were excellent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having encouraged passengers to check-in online and save it staff time and money, what does BA do? It reduces the number of staff for bag drop to the barest minimum. Business class bag drop at 08:30 at Heathrow had mostly empty desks and a queue resulting in a quite unacceptable wait of more than 15 minutes. Then having raced through security, there was the almost inevitable flight delay, only this time the 40-minute delay to the incoming aircraft was a result, we were told, of someone forgetting to tow the plane on to the stand from another part of the airport! With flights taking off to the west, there was yet another 20 minutes delay during taxiing. Only crisps or a couple of sweet biscuits were offered along with drinks. Sadly the gap between the national airline and budget carriers just gets closer all the time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA2678, LGW-DBV, 16/06/15, return BA2679, DBV-LGW, 27/06/15. Baggage drop very fast at the BA check in. Then had to wait 10 minutes for the the express sercurity to open didnt open at 5.30 am as stated. The lounge at Gatwick excellent, good selection of food and drinks. Priority boarding very good. The flight out very good, nothing was too much trouble for the cabin crew. On the return again fast check in, then queued for 20 minutes to get through customs (no fast check in) once through went to the lounge - ok but not as good as Gatwick. Priority boarding poor at Dubrovnik, all put on a bus to be taken to the aircraft. Cabin crew not as freindly on the return journey. Both flights about on time. The only complaint is the club europe seating, you pay a lot more for theese seats, but the legroom is the same as economy leg room. Come on BA put it back to 34 inches as you are just giving more buisness to Easyjet and Ryanair.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Overall the journey was good. The breakfast was okay, we were served sandwiches which weren't that appetizing. The cabin had recently been refurbished, it was very clean and new with mood lighting. Screens coming down from the ceiling provided us with a moving map. Overall a good flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "If I could give it a Zero I would. From the moment we checked flight departure time and were incorrectly informed resulting in waiting to board for over 3 hours, to the incorrect arrival time as stated on the IFE screen. A 12 hour flight with only 1 main meal plus a snack served - without any drinks. Their idea of an Asian vegetarian meal is grilled vegetables and rice, drinks only served when the staff were either not sleeping or chatting away. Very uncomfortable hard seat, aisles so small that most passengers had their legs stuck out in the aisles and finally finishing with nearly an hour getting thru customs to then having to wait 20 minutes for my luggage. Can you please get off your backsides BA, and fly economy with Singapore Airlines as they still realize it's human beings they are transporting.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was amazed that this airline charges extra to book a seat in advance. I have never seen that on any of the non-discount carriers, especially in business class. When I pay for a business seat I expect that seat section will be free and I won't be charged for another $147. The b-class is not uncomfortable, just configured weirdly, with little storage space near the seat. The FAs have to constantly lean over the person in the aisle to get to the person at the window, which is annoying and probably makes extra work for them. The food was flat out lousy-it looked like bad microwave fare. The service was OK, nothing special. Although I wasn't going to watch any in-flight entertainment, I did check it out. Pretty meager selection. If given a choice, I don't think I will fly BA after this trip is over.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew First Class 2A from Chicago to London, easy boarding and excellent service provided at all times by the cabin crew in First Class. The food was excellent and a good selection available too. Breakfast was good with a nice selection with plenty of organge juice and tea which came in a pot which was a lovely touch. If you are flying British Airways and connecting from an American Airlines domestic flight do note that you can now transfer from T3 to T5 at Chicago airside by shuttle bus which runs every 30 mins thus avoiding the security lines in T5, this applies only to BA Passengers tranferring from an American Airlines or American Eagle flight to a British Airways flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Recently flew BA from LHR to ORD, 64A, Upper Deck in Club World. Excellent experience with great service and a good food selection too. The crew were professional and very attentive but the ration of crew to passengers hels as there are only 20 seats on the upper deck with two dedicated crew. The seat was comfortable with plenty of room and storage under the windows was a great help too. The inflight entertainment was OK but the selection was very limited compared to what it used to be, BA could do more to add a much wider variety to its film selection, otherwise a great flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways short-haul economy product is fine especially if the flight time is only 50 minutes in the air. British Airways staff are friendly and professional but why has there been such a drastic fall in standards? They try to save money by not serving you napkins with the drink. And the drinks come in plastic cups that could have been more stylish. Little things like these tell a lot about an airline. But at least drinks and snacks were free.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Travelled on August 8th when there was a power outage at London Heathrow which resulted in missing baggage. The way BA handled is pathetic with no proper communication regarding status of bags. I called several times and had to go to the airport twice. There was much confusion with the BA people claiming 2 of the tags issued were not found in their system so no claim was made for these missing bags. No follow up though I was promised they will call me later that day on the 10th. Finally the bags arrived on the 11th but the whole experience left me not wanting to travel with BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flying out on Sunday received call from BA saying they are changing aircraft from A380 to B777 so were asking passengers if they could fly out earlier. I couldn't and there was no pressure to do so by the friendly agent. Check in at Dulles smooth, lounge surprisingly very nice (much above your usual state side) and opposite BA gate. Aircraft B777 full flight, probably around 100 business class passengers so too many to know by name and no effort was made by cabin crew. Seats cramped (as expected). Did not eat on board as had dined in the lounge. A few drinks, part of a film then tried to get some sleep on the 7 hour flight. Landed earlier then expected but then had to wait half hour for luggage . Overall Cabin Crew very good, aircraft clean. Nowadays if I fly First with BA I expect Business and if I fly Business I expect Economy plus. That way I'm not disappointed.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Where shall I start, 4 hours delay or the days without my luggage? I came to Nassau for my wedding, me, my wife and our 3 best friends. We arrived to Nassau on Tuesday with 4 hours delay, but the most annoying part just begun. Our wedding was on Friday, me and my wife were without luggage until Thursday, due to hell knows what was going on in BA, my best mate, didn't receive his luggage for a week, and on my wedding he was best man, so I had to give him cloths to wear. We had to change the organized wedding date, to another, 3 days later. He received his luggage on a last day of his staying in Nassau. From the first day arrival, BA was contacting us and saying same thing, the luggage is coming next day, and that was for me 3 days, my friend 1 week. When I received my bag, they lost my key, that I gave in airport in Nassau to BA person, I signed the contract that I agree when my luggage arrive they can open it and check it. They lost my key and I had to cut my bag to eventually get my cloths. The plane was old, but pretty well maintained. Me and my wife slept half flight, but when we woke up, the cabin crew told us that we can't have warm food anymore - we had 3 hours to fly, and  we were hungry. BA, you almost ruined my wedding, you ruined all my friends staying, he received his bag on a last day vacation. All BA flight to Nassau that week were all delayed, from 2 to 6 hours. Never, ever again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was my first time on a long haul flight with British Airways. I found the seats to be very comfortable until a woman in front pushed her seat right back so then the video screen was almost in my face. She refused to put it back when we asked politely. She got out of her seat and stood on my foot which had been recovering from a broken bone, then laughed with her friend. I detected she could cause trouble so decided it was time to move. I explained to the air hostess who immediately accommodated us. She came back a few minutes later to ask if I would like tea and if all was ok. She also brought a colleague with her. I found the staff to be ultra helpful and pleasant. The food was good quality for economy. Previously I would have flown Air Canada but I think British Airways are a better quality airline. I would have no hesitation in recommending British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I fly 95% for pleasure and often take advantage of Avios reward flights coupled with BA Amex companion offers and with careful planning, we seem to always find something in business for my wife and I and then pay for our 6 yr old boy, which given his age, has to include the half term and summer holiday periods. My best experience recently was flying the to Las Vegas on an ageing B747, but this was overcome by the decision to offer us the option of sitting in the \"Old\" First Cabin, which my wife and I took full advantage of and was very comfortable, quiet and private. We did the same on the way back, but because of an aircraft change we found ourselves flying in a refurbished New First which was the icing on the cake (all of this for just £2000 each in the BA sale). This type of service can also be repeated on short haul with excellent food for an airline. My only gripes are the use of tiny A319's on the Paphos route which is too small a plane for such a long route and I'm not a big fan of the decision to reduce legroom in the new Club Europe, however the exclusion of the middle seat does give enough room for you legs. Having flown with Qantas and Emirates in Y Class recently I genuinely don't believe they are much further ahead of BA, my A380 experience on Qantas was distinctly ordinary for a premium product.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Staff was helpful in both cities. The plane was on the older side, but clean. The tv's were not the biggest, but a wide selection of movies, tv shows, and music. The seats were comfortable and a good amount of legroom. The service was great and flight attendants attentive, food was good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very poor flight. Broken seats, toilet stuck together with tape and everything rattled around like an old car. The inflight \"entertainment\" was terrible, screen tiny and very poor quality. Staff pretended to be interested and made glib promises about refund and upgrades for the way home which turned out to be a pack of lies. I guess it was get them off the plane and I will not see them again. My various email to BA were met with a standard letter and an offer of a 50 pound refund. An insult considering the thousands paid for the air fare.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bologna - London was in economy class, they gave us a sandwich, flight attendants not super polite and not unpolite -  doing their job. London to Montreal I was in businness class and liked the seats. One flight attendant was Italian and she was informed that me and my collegue are Italian, she gave us a warm welcome and took good care of us during the flight. The amenities weren't amazing - just 1 small lotion, sleeping mask, socks and 1 pen. The food wasn't what you expect from a businness class, it looked like the same as they serve in economy class.: 1 occurrences\n",

Cabin Crew were great and encouraged people to order more drinks and have more food and couldn't do enough for people. Overall the best of BA. Great arrival at T5, even with having a checked bag was out in 20 mins.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I flew from Toronto to London (return) using BA Business Class in July of this year. This was part of a \"trip of a lifetime\" we had planned to the UK. We have never flown business class, so decided to spend the big dollars for a return trip. I am not sure if it was worth it at all! Toronto to London was an overnight flight, London to Toronto an afternoon flight.  Ease of booking online was very good, Customer Service on phone was poor (obviously outsourced so a language barrier!). Check in at Toronto was average, nothing above check in at any other counter. Lounge at Toronto very good, great food, drinks, service, facilities. Aircraft cabin with average state of wear Seats - center rear facing seats. Comfortable but lacking any type of space (the lie flat bed was good) Cabin crew were on auto pilot - not rude but certainly not great,  Food was average. The return trip (Heathrow Terminal 5) to Toronto was not really any better. The business class lounge at Heathrow was not good. Lousy food, looks very worn, very busy, travelers sleeping across multiple seats, bathrooms were average .I would have rather taken my chances in the regular lounge area or gone into one of the many sit down restaurants. The distance from the main concourse (after security) to the lounge is quite long and the distance to your gate (especially if it is in the B or C sections) is a great distance, and involves a train ride! Same seat on the return trip, so again average. Food, service etc all average. Overall, we were not impressed with British Airways Business, and would not use them again (consider Air Canada or another airline). I flew Air Transat Club class 2 month prior to the UK, and I enjoyed it a lot more (and a hell of a lot cheaper!) British Airways did not impress!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I didn't really know what to expect from this flight, it had been a couple of years since my last BA flight (Gatwick to Nice in that case) we were on our way to Lyon Airport from the city centre and noticed the flight had only just departed London. Upon arrival at the airport we found it to be delayed by 40 minutes. With little information given as to why. When we finally got round to boarding there was no organisation, a bit like every man for himself. What amused me was that the captain came on over the PA and encouraged passengers to hurry and take their seats as we had only 9 minutes to keep our slot. Safe to say because of the lack of organisation we missed our slot and we sat on the aircraft for another 50 minutes while we awaited a new slot. The captain kept us informed as best he could, the cabin crew showed no effort at all. They showed no will to actually be there, they didn't check on passengers bearing in mind it was 39°C outside and this was affecting the temperature inside the aircraft. Once we took off the service seemed rushed, I wasn't able to get any food at the airport so was hoping for something that would keep me full on the journey back, no so much a pitiful Ham and Cheese bun thing and a drink. There was no personal touch to it. As we were approaching Heathrow all we could hear from the rear galley (we were in the back row) was the two crew complaining about their hours. I'm flying with BA Citiflyer to Dublin in September, if the service hasn't improved I'll think twice if I really need to travel BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Given BA's bizarre and relentless assault on its premium passengers, dropped back to economy as no point flying club Europe given seat leg room now the same. Nice new interior so clean, adequate seat, flight left on time, quick baggage pick up-didn't bother with the sandwich offered, my daughter did, couldn't really see any difference than the sandwich being offered in club except it's served in a box. Crew made no effort to disguise their desire to be somewhere else. Overall I expected little and so not disappointed. Decent value for money, but just another flight and a few hours to watch a film on the iPad.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Miami return. Flew out with 5 children, one was an infant turning 2 during holiday. Had necessary booking for seat on return and booking number and email assuring me bookings were linked and there would be no issue. Upon checking in to return was met with rude staff who commented \"don't even touch that it's hassle just refer her to ticketing\" where I spent the next two hours waiting for them to check me in. My flight closed and took off without me - despite me constantly stressing that I had a child with a fractured leg and medical assistance all linked to the flight. Long story short, I was dumped on next flight after 3 hours waiting at desk with 5 children, no explanation of what was going on - people being served all around me by person who was supposed to be dealing with me, no child meals were transferred and all assistance was abandoned as was connected with previous flight. Resulted in me being stranded at Heathrow as my 7 seater taxi had left and was impossible to book another. However this wasn't all - check in staff went on to tell me that my 32 kilo case could not be boarded as it was too heavy under health and safety regulations. I had to throw away 8 kilos worth of clothing. This was despite me being 48 kilos under my overall baggage allowance and receiving a sticker labelled 'heavy bags must not weigh more than 32 kilos'. Had a further 3 hour wait at the other end as all medical assistance booked had not been transferred as requested. Would never fly British Airways again due to the complete and utter incompetence of the ground staff at Miami.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been flying with British Airways on the LHR-GVA route for a while now, and the original excellent service has been declining. I am an Executive Club silver member and due to changes to the Executive Club I am now earning a lot less avios and tier points than I used to. Also the slimmer seats on the aircraft, in this case a rather old A319, are much less comfortable and roomy. I find it quite tight and I am not especially tall at 6ft. The cabin crew were not particularly attentive but friendly. They barely bothered with the passengers onboard even though the flight was nearly empty. Overall it is disappointing that our flag carrier is becoming more like Ryanair with every 'enhancment' they make. I have recently tried Swiss on this route and they were cheaper and provided a superior service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated. I fly the LHR-PHX-LHR route on a monthly basis and although I've spoken to colleagues about changing carrier, as BA offers the only direct route into Phoenix I have stuck with them. But where to begin? The 747-400s used are ageing, shabby and tired, if they were your old horse they'd have been taken to the knacker's yard years ago. Throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable, space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. The AVOD in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity, the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. When the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. Catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business, although I see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. One word of caution here - if you are upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. All in all BA is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected, LHR lounges are in need of a complete makeover and it's a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work. I've one more BA flight to go and then it's adieu from me, but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now it's not like I'm going to miss them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Did this same trip last summer with delays etc but thought we had just been unlucky but history repeated itself. All legs were delayed. Technical issues or weather were blamed. BA do not seem to have much in the way of contingency plans and particularly where terminal 5 at Heathrow is concerned it takes very little weather to throw the whole place into confusion. At all points information was lacking or contradictory. I cannot decide if they lie or are so inept that they do not communicate with each other. Eg our internal flight home was showing as being subject to big delays for hours online. When we arrived at the gate the delay was announced as a sudden crew issue. A new thing this year seemed to be to bring out the captain to speak to passengers - maybe we were supposed to be charmed. This happened both at Heathrow and Boston. On the long haul flights the seats were tiny ( the internal ones were better which seems strange), on both long haul legs of the journey the entertainment system did not work and the food was lamentable and definitely worse than a few years ago. The cabin crew were nice but that's about it.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The British Airways plane I flew on from Larnaca - an ageing 767 - was clearly tired and while clean, looked frayed around the edges. Club Europe offers a free seat next to you but this was not on offer on the 767 so it also felt a little cramped, especially as the seat is no different from the Economy seat. Food was acceptable, but not the best I have been offered on European business class flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This is a very mediocre Business Class product and definitely not up to the standards of other airlines. The seats are tight with no storage space for even a bottle of water and the configuration is poor. I had 16K as I was told it is the best seat in the cabin - back corner, rear facing but very private. Forget any meal choice - being at the back means you get what you are given. Wines were ok but the food was ordinary. The crew were probably the best part of the whole experience - but they are nowhere near the standard set by Qantas crew. You can do far better with Qantas, Emirates or Cathay - forget travelling with BA as it's just not worth it.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My family and I flew from Rotterdam to London on 26th of June, and it's our first time traveling with BA. We chose it as we thought this airlines would be better than budget airlines with constant delays. We were very wrong. We arrived at the airport on time and sat down to wait. BA announced flight delays due to \"technical\" error for 1.5 hours before finally announcing that the flight was cancelled. We were given no explanation except for one phrase \"technical fault\". We were then unceremoniously sent back to queue in line to be rescheduled. We waited another 45 mins and was then transferred to a 7.20pm flight (original was 1.05pm). We were denied all chances to board an earlier one at 4pm. We did not complain or gave BA any trouble. We followed procedures and applied for compensation online. Their reply was simply a sorry and they denied all responsibilities.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Returning from Chicago to Berlin, the overall flight experience was no better than the outward sectors a week earlier. I opted to skip dinner and instead have breakfast since the flight landed around 10:00. Breakfast was a hard slab of cake with one drink - a total disgrace! Once again the cabin was too warm and I saw no passengers using their blankets. The Berlin flight ex-LHR was delayed, initially due to the usual \"late incoming aircraft\" excuse, and then to a broken APU. So no air was being pumped in to the cabin and the engines could not be started! For some reason it then took half an hour to locate one that did actually work. Meanwhile on one of the hottest days of the year we waited on board in increasingly sauna-like conditions. The captain kept us informed and then made up a bit if time, although we still landed 35 minutes late.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "What on earth has happened to British Airways inflight meals? On our way out to Rome, we were told that the plane had to be changed, so when we were only offered a stone cold croissant with cheddar cheese in it I thought well, OK, maybe the reason for that is because of the change of planes so no hot meals available. However, on our return, not only did we have an hour delay (still not sure why that happened, we were traveling with a 1 year old baby, so it was quite stressful just waiting around), but on our flight our \"meal\" was half a sandwich with a bit of bacon and  lettuce, they said chicken was in it, but I didn't have any in mine. That was it, no hot drink either, the drinks trolley did come round once so we were then offered a soft drink, or there were small spirits if you wanted them but the food was appalling. I'm not a fussy person, but I thought a meal on the plane consisted of something hot, I didn't have time to eat anything at the airport, and arrived home at midnight, I was starving.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "If Brirish Airways honestly thinks they are a premium, quality airline they need a look at people like myself who have had one after another bad experiences - arrogance, trading on past glories, old cabins, high prices, the list goes on. I booked a flight to Florence through BA website, received a British Airways e-ticket and only found out on the day when trying to check in that I was flying with Vueling. Never heard of them. To cut a very long story short we were delayed 8 hours, nothing said to us and nothing offered at this stage. At the gate, when we finally got there, one of the customers checked their website to find the flight had not left Italy yet. We informed the ground staff. They did not day a thing. After half an hour trying to get answers from them we were told we would have to wait till the next flight arrived (how long we couldn't be told) and they would then fly us to a different airport 2 hours away and arrange a bus transfer. I headed straight back the the terminal and sought a British Airways rep to try and get an answer, firstly because that is who I booked my ticket through and secondly as Vueling have no representation at the airport. I was told it had nothing to do with British Airways and they couldn't help. I explained the situation again and asked to speak to a Supervisor. I was denied that right. I by chance saw a 'Customer Service Representative' walking past 5 minutes later and asked to speak to him. He looked at me as if I had 2 heads and in the end walked away after calling me an 'ar----le'. 100% true, in the middle of Gatwick North Terminal. My wife and 6 week old child were themselves waiting at Florence 4 hours for me. We were told Vueling were going to try and get us out the following day. But no guarantees. I booked another flight with British Airways to get to my family, and British Airways have offered nothing, not even an apology. Vueling will refund our flight if we go through the correct procedures. British Airways should be ashamed of what they have become.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-NCL-LHR economy on newly refitted Airbus narrowbody. The seats have so little legroom, it has the feeling of a budget airline (far from budget prices!) but OK for a short flight. The problem is this seat configuration is used throughout Europe and it's possible to be in such cramped conditions for a longer flight. Upgrading to business isn't a solution as there's no extra legroom on these planes. Have flown both Swiss and Norwegian in the past few weeks as well. Both had more legroom. Would recommend Norwegian (great airline - cheap, comfy, free wifi) but not Swiss (dreadful customer service). BA cabin staff continue to be very mixed : some attentive, polite and helpful. Others are downright rude (as one was on this flight) Overall, BA can be great, but sometimes not so much.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A pleasant trip with British Airways as usual but suffered a 60 minute delay, for which the Captain apologised for when we boarded. Inflight entertainment was on mainscreen and showed a range of programs and the onboard service was good, especially as it was a jam packed flight. However, these planes are rather old and neither my seat nor the one next to me had a working headphone jack. British Airways is a standard airline, but not as good as other major scheduled airlines. I find it tends to be rather hit and miss when it comes to the quality of cabin crew and aircraft.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "My return British Airways flight from Dubai to LHR started badly with the worst lounge experience I have ever visited. A shared lounge for Club and First Class - in either class it is terrible. Tatty and years past a refurbishment. Given that BA has flown this route for decades, one does wonder what they are playing at. I could only enviously look at a pristine Emirates lounge across the departure hall. My wife tried the \"breakfast\" - a dried up sausage and disgusting scrambled eggs. She declared she would not give it to our dog Charlie, a cocker spaniel. The boarding gate was miles away and BA shipped us over to gate in a golf buggy. It took ages! Apparently they are installing a First lounge later this year, the same story I heard at LAX last year. The flight left on time. FAs were terrific and it seems BA rely on crew to make or break every flight nowadays. The seat was much better than outbound on a Boeing 747. Food okay - starter of \"dried\" Asian duck was fantastic. Soup very good. Grilled salmon okay - a bit dry. Wines very good and chilled properly, which is often not the case. Only four passengers in First - including my wife and I. It wasn't too bad - but there is no wow factor. Shame.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight was delayed due to a fuelling problem with the aircraft, despite it having been sitting on the ground for 9 hours between flights. The lounges are full of dirty plates and glasses on every table and the food is insufficient for the volume of passengers. Antiquated entertainment system kept coming up with \"please wait\" several times during the flight, whilst the cabin crew gave apology announcements and kept trying to reset it. British Airways Club World meals are full of packets and wrappers which doesn't exactly reflect a premium product. The cabin looks old and tired. The amenity kit is cheap and useless. I paid to reserve a particular seat and it was changed due to unexplained \"operational reasons\". Terminal 5 (which is British Airways  home) had a complete baggage system breakdown causing queues and chaos, so my luggage arrived 3 days after I did. What is there to like about BA?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight from Moscow to London on an old Boeing 777-200 which needs replacing soon. Bar service and hot lunch served, washroom was clean.

      "I flew from Los Angeles to London with British Airways, who seem to be working hard to improve things. What I cannot understand is why they still have not updated their Club World seating after so many years. Even the US carriers offer superior seating these days. I don't get it - new British Airways plane but same old seats. While they are fully flat and I slept well, the main issues are having to step over other passengers as there is no direct aisle access and a lack of storage space and cubby holes around the seat. The cabin crew were mature, professional, and the CSD introduced himself during the flight and seemed genuine. Catering seems to have improved - I chose the beef for dinner and instead of the usual overcooked lump in a casserole dish it was cooked well and plated similar to what all first rate airlines do in Business class these days.

Heard one say to a young man \"you should have got up earlier\". Only when we got restless did they open the fence to let us go to an idle check in operator. Then the \"priority\" security process was nonsense, just as slow as elsewhere. Staff on board excellent. On return journey I checked in online as usual. Changed our seats to the final row. Got on board to find the row had no window. Flight too full to move elsewhere. Partner a very nervous flyer and had a horrible journey back, felt he was in a coffin, and heart flutter returned next day due to stress of the journey. All made worse by 30 min delay on departure and a further 30 min delay before being allowed to land at LHR. Next day I contacted British Airways customer services online to ask why there was no indication at all on the aircraft seat plan that row 25 on A319 had no window. No response at all apart from automated \"we're busy but will get back to you asap\". A week later I sent the same response, with original complaint number, again online. No response at all, not even the automated one. I'm left feeling that British Airways is nowRyanair, though even they have been trying to improve their service and image recently. The days of British Airways as a classic British airline, with good service and professionalism went with the sale of it to other nations. It is not what it appears. We also noted that cabin staff in economy could barely cope with a full cabin. Instead of a trolley starting at either end, there was only one with two staff. For the \"widest short range jet\" of 25 rows, 6 across this was not enough. Costs have been cut, clearly staff are demoralised and customer service has gone out of the window. Obviously, not the window at row 25.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "30th wedding anniversary ruined due to British Airways not loading baggage onto flight - not just ours but the whole flight! Baggage handling belts broken so baggage all piled up in departure lounge. Baggage tracking website does not work, so that's a waste of time! Call centre in London diverts to call centre in India so you can't understand a thing being said and vice versa. Pilot and staff must have known there was no baggage in hold and yet the flight was still allowed to leave. Italian contact number for British Airways lost luggage was unobtainable and given out regardless of that fact. Would not recommend British Airways to my worst enemy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Worst experience I've ever had in an airport, poor organisation with bad customer service from British Airways staff who didn't care that I would have a 5 hour delay, due to been told I would need to cancel and rebook my conecting internal flight. As my flight was delayed between JFK and Heathrow. I was appalled to see how badly immigration was dealt with and how little effort British Airways put into organising its customers. Some people where told to go to a service desk and cancel and rebook flights, while others got put in a fast track immigration queue. No staff seemed to care about the delay my partner and I were experiencing after a 7 hour flight. I would never recommend British Airways to anyone. They only care about premium paying passengers and the service they claim to offer has been left behind by other providers. Absolute garbage!!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways Economy on a Boeing 777, London to Bangkok. The seat was terrible, had the IFE release knob wedged in my leg for 12 hours and a food tray that could not open so unable to eat. Stewardess asked if I would like to put food tray on my lap. The seat was not fit for purpose.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The Concorde Lounge is a long way in the terminal, and after queuing, placed on the bus to the aircraft along with all the other passengers - and wait standing in the crushed bus on the tarmac for 20 minutes. Once onboard, I asked for a Vodka Martini, (not too difficult surely). After a 20 minute wait, the steward informed me he was sorry for the delay, but he had no Martini glasses. Okay, this was British Airways First class, but not such a huge deal, he offered it to me in a Wine glass instead not a big problem.  20 minutes later he returned and said he couldn't serve me a Vodla Martini as there was no Martini on the plane.  Then came the 'Dine as you please' meal option. I asked for my dinner to be served 2 hours into the flight, I was asked my choice and chose the Steak - to be told there was no Steak left.  It was 'suggested' I try the fish, I do not like fish, so I was left with Vegetarian option. The dinner arrived half an hour later, not the two hours later as I requested.  I would never choose to fly British Airways First class again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My British Airways return trip from Milan to Vancouver via back wasn't too bad, but the seats were really unconfortable and there wasn't enough leg room. Furthermore the flights took off late, so i ended up having little time to take the connections. There is definitely space for improvement at British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have flown regularly with British Airways between the UK and other European countries, where economy class seats are leather and reasonable onboard service. Based on previous experience, I decided to make an intercontinental flight between the UK and Rio de Janeiro Brazil believing that I would find at least the same comfort offered on European routes by British Airways. It was not. Instead of decent seat conditions expected for a 11 hours duration flight, I found seats that barely accommodate a normal person (not so tall, not overweight) and completely unable to have a decent meal during the flight. The economy class of British Airways can be defined as simply terrible. Do not waste your money by paying a bit more believing you will find comfort in an intercontinental flight flying economy class with British Airways. Just buy the cheapest promotional airline ticket that you find on market, you'll be served the same way and will save some money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Absolutely disgusted, delayed by 45 min with no reasons on a quiet night with one other international flight. Baby seat too small, no infant meal available after confirmation at check-in. Entertainment system stuck on a loop and not working. Dirt between seats that is disgusting. Old seats and flight. Flying in 2015 this must be a 20 year old flight, not comfortable. However good leg room.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was booked in First Class (as a paying passenger) on this airline but went to check in and was told they had oversold the flight. I was bumped onto a Qantas flight leaving half an hour later (via Dubai) which may have been a blessing in disguise as Qantas was outstanding - see my seperate review. I chose the flight with BA via Singapore for timing reasons for sleep - and for the use of the First Class arrivals lounge at Heathrow as I had a flight onto Berlin several hours later. By going via Dubai it threw my sleep out and no arrivals lounge to use. I had to change terminals and beg my way into a standard BA lounge - which was no mean feat. What really annoyed me about this was BA's attitude to the whole thing. Firstly, I am of the opinion that no plane should be oversold, least of all First Class. I was after some compensation for the inconvenience they caused - and eventually they offered me a £200 voucher after weeks of back and forth emails. I had a Business Class return ticket to Sydney and was after an upgrade as compensation - not unreasonable, otherwise I wouldn't have asked for it. The whole experience of dealing with BA in regard to this was awful. For a fare paying First Class passenger to be bumped off a flight and be treated so disrespectfully after the event is a poor reflection on their level of professionalism. I will not be travelling with this airline again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Another excellent experience with BA. Very fast check in at Glasgow for Exec Club status holders (prioritised over a large queue) and the quickest security I've had at an airport. Though small, the BA lounge at Glasgow is smart, well designed and well stocked. Welcomed by friendly staff, good selection of sandwiches, cheeses, snacks and alcohol, and happily provided a glass of champagne on request. Loved the little whisky nook! Priority boarding was honoured and had row 1 seating on this former BMI A319. Good welcome by staff and adequate legroom. First Officer was informative and we took off ahead of schedule. For a 1 hour flight the crew provided a good service of snacks (crisps and biscuits) and a full bar excluding champagne (no CE service on domestic routes). Seats and toilets were clean and we landed ahead of schedule. My only gripe was that we taxied at an international gate and had to wait to be bussed to the domestic area, but this was only 10-15 minutes in total and staff were helpful throughout. Overall an excellent experience and as a silver card holder, my loyalty to BA remains intact.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew BA Club Europe from LHR-IST in late June. I'm fond of the aging 767's used on this route. Although they've seen better days and there is some wear and tear, I prefer these older seats to the new CE seats as they're deeper with better legroom and padding. T5 South lounge busy for a morning departure but staff were visible and food/wines well stocked. Champagne delivered promptly and courteously. Priority boarding honoured and selected row 1 centre bulkhead seats - although slightly narrower these were comfortable and the extra legroom is a bonus. Team of 3 serving a full CE cabin and CSD was excellent (addressed by name, magazines offered etc). No menus distributed outbound which was unusual but blanket and headphones provided at seat. Food choices were typical CE offerings (beef cheeks or chicken curry) but enjoyable nonetheless - drinks plentiful and free flowing. Flight made good time and kept informed by friendly captain throughout. Priority luggage and fast track security we're honoured and overall this was another excellent experience with BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "GLA-LGW fine for a domestic flight, small snack and drink, crew pleasant enough, but arrival process at Gatwick was irritating. My next flight from LHR so after a rather fraught journey across London I checked in at Terminal 5 and had to wait while check in assistant called several numbers trying to get a \"Visa Check\" performed by a member of staff who came to the desk to check my documentation. The flight to Moscow began with a long bus journey (longer than the one already endured at Gatwick) around Heathrow tarmac to the waiting aircraft. The flight was due to leave at 21:50 and although the seat was comfortable, the aircraft was extremely hot and stuffy for the duration of the flight. The crew appeared impatient with passengers and quickly served a small sandwich and drink. Another drinks run would have been appreciated as the heat in the cabin was almost nauseating. Arrival in Domodedovo airport at 03:40 local time. Not BA's best effort but nothing seriously wrong.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bag drop at Moscow Domodedovo was quick and efficient, but no smile by ground handling agent. This didn't bother me, as she did confirm my bag would travel all the way to Glasgow. The aircraft was too large for the small boarding lounge, but plenty of shops and restaurants to pass the short time I had to wait. I was seated to the rear of the lower deck, in a window seat where the aircraft narrows from 3 seats to 2, so I had a good amount of extra space beside and in front of my seat. The crew were pleasant, some appeared a little intimidated by some Russian passengers when they were asking for drinks or indicating their meal choice. I noticed from their name badges that many of them spoke languages in addition to English, but I didn't see any who spoke Russian. After drinks service the meal was served, including a vegetarian choice. This was in contrast to the outbound overnight flight in my other review. The flight crew updated regularly. I liked the use of the Boeing 747 on the route, although internally it is beginning to appear dated.  At Heathrow, multiple boarding card, passport and security checks combine to produce an awkward process. The flight to Glasgow on an A321. The cabin crew gave an impression of efficiency and friendliness. A short flight with time for a drink and small snack. On arrival at Glasgow, I found a wheel missing from my 4-wheeled trolley case, rendering it unusable. I mentioned this to the ground handling agent, but she confirmed that unlike some of the low-cost carriers, BA do not take responsibility for such damage.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The staff were friendly and food was good, selection of films was more than satisfactory. However, due to a power failure at Heathrow our luggage did not make it on our flight. I was appalled to see that there was no back up at all in the first place, but then we were told our baggage would be with us within two days by one of British Airways staff. It is now nearly our fourth day on holiday and we still have not got our bags. I understand that this happens and sometimes is inevitable, but I am most dissatisfied by the information British Airways are able to provide us about our bags. All we know is that they have left Heathrow; we don't know which airport they were flown to, if they arrived, where they are or when we can expect them. They have no details of any individual bags and I think this is disgusting service. The staff have been unhelpful and unwilling to aid us in finding our luggage, which has spoiled our holiday completely and left us in a dofficult situation with 4 children under 12.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I selected British Airways on this trip, ahead of Air China who I've used a few times from Beijing. What a mistake, because despite some of the problems with Chinese airlines, they offer a far superior service to British Airways. The cabin, seats etc were dirty and claustrophobic on this British Airways flight, and I bitterly regret my patriotism in selected them for this trip. Food is basically on a par with many Asian airlines Economy class standards, and you need to be very cautious about believing any of the marketing rubbish that British Airways provide in different areas. This is not a premium experience, and was a true waste of money. Staff were on another planet as far as service was concerned - abrupt, unsmiling and intent on getting service over as quickly as possible, before they retired to gossip loudly in the galley. Using the call button was a waste of time midflight, I guess they were all resting by then. I know that on Air China the wine may be served rather warm, a cold beer is hard to get, and staff language skills are limited to standard phrases, but their staff are cheerful, enthusiastic to serve customers - and their business seats a lot more comfortable. The British Airways motto of flying to serve should be challenged in court as a blatant misrepresentation. Luckily my company doesn't restrict me on airline choice, and this will be my last trip on British Airways, who I first flew in the 1960's when they were a truly great BOAC.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My experience chimes with the general consensus on the Club World service LHR-JFK. Cabin, seats and fittings are showing their age and look rather shabby by this point. Not too clean, red wine spills on my foot rest when I boarded. Tiny screen and IFE looked dated, not great entertainment selection. The food quality was good but service from cabin crew was rather indifferent with little attempt to make it a special dining experience. Nuts and chocolates served in packets, not bowls. Not attentive over providing drinks refills or water. I wasnt offered all of the items listed on the menu - where did my fruit and cheese platter go? Had to ask for coffee/tea refills after the meal. Brewed coffee only - no fresh lattes/cappuccinos. Was not offered disgestifs after the meal. Cabin crew disappeared after the meal. Self service snacks in the galley were economy quality (apart from some nice rose champagne). Just not a luxury or experience! Felt like I was in economy but with more space and food.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "On this occasion my partner and I experienced a 3.5 hour delay with BA. There was no communication at the airport, nothing until we got onto the plane where the captain told us delays were due to a bag that had not been checked in correctly at Heathrow. Because of the delay when the plane finally arrived it had no water on board and was not permitted to fill up at our destination. This meant disgusting toilets because of no flush and no warm drinks on board. We were sat on the runway for an hour because the engines would not start. We had no aircon for 40 mins. When we finally got back to Heathrow the captain told us that he was sorry for the issues.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Boarding well organised and efficient. Seated in World Traveller on the upper deck. 2x4x2 on this deck is preferable to the 3x4x3 on the lower deck. Flight attendants welcome customers on board and service was friendly and professional. Seat fairly comfortable. Legroom standard for economy. IFE excellent; a huge range of entertainment options. The disappointment was lunch. The chicken casserole was basically a few pieces of chicken swimming in oil with a few vegetables. Very poor. Afternoon tea, on the other hand, was nice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "YUL to FCO and BCN to YUL. PTV on each for e long haul planes, entertainment did the job and it was activated when I boarded the aircraft.

No flight delays on outbound journey but 3 hour delay on the return flight where the aircraft has to be changed due to the mechanical problem.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways charged me $100.00 for a \"too large\" carry on leaving my destination, even though I used the same carry on traveling to my destination without charge and have never been charged for this carry on - it fit into the carry on size check in front of his eyes but he continued to tell me that it was too big and I needed to be charged. I had to call and email multiple times to get this investigated and which point they told me that day your carry on was too large and you needed to pay the fine, no refund. Will never fly with this company again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "From the lack of customer service both in their call centre and from their cabin crew through to not being seated next to my husband on a 24 hour flight, I am thoroughly disappointed with British Airways. My husband and I travelled on separate bookings and were flying back from London to Sydney together. I phoned British Airways 3 days before my flight from London to ask them to link our booking numbers so we would be seated on the flight together. I was informed they could link the numbers but not guarantee we would be seated next to each other. However if I wanted to buy my seat in advance then this would be guaranteed. I was not giving this money-grabbing airline another opportunity to take more money from me so I refused this option. My husband tweeted the airline and received two more replies stating they could not help with this. When online check in opened my husband and I were allocated seats 10 rows apart and could not change this. Phoning the call centre resulted in being told the check-in staff could assist. Arriving at Heathrow the check in staff informed us there was nothing they could do but ask at the gate. The staff at the gate told us they could do nothing and had already told another family they would not be seated together. The only person who offered any form of assistance was a wonderful staff member at Changi airport on the transfer desk when we stopped, who managed to seat me across the aisle from my husband from the Singapore-Sydney leg. This woman did not even work for British Airways but was the most helpful. Not one British Airways staff member apologised for this. The cabin crew on both flights clearly did not enjoy working in Economy. A request for alternative food was ignored repeatedly and staff were outright rude to passengers who asked for a landing card towards the end of the flight (I was told to go get it myself at the back of the plane). I will only be flying with Emirates or Singapore Airlines in the future who know how to look after their passengers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am a Silver Card Holder, work in aviation and fly around 3-4 times a week. Up to 2 months ago I was loyal to BA as it is an 'English Airline with English Values' but this loyalty was unfounded. My main issue now with BA is the age and quality of the aircraft they are now flying. On frequent trips to Dubai with BA on a 30+ year old 747-400, it seems that BA has removed all cabin quality standards and is waiting to send the aircraft to the graveyard. The seats were old and falling apart, not one thing on this aircraft worked correctly. The arm rests were damaged and the cushions flattened. The inflight entertainment was shambolic, the screens did not work correctly and were in need of either overhaul or an upgrade about 10 years ago. On short haul flights, in business (LHR-MUN), the 'upgraded cabin' is a bit of a con. The seats are lightweight. Uncomfortable seat foam with less leg room, the faux leather is horrible to sit on and does not let you breath especially when you are sitting on the aircraft without AC on. My worst experience was trying to fly back to Munich from London. It was an old A320. As we took off the pilot had to do an emergency landing. On landing, they say that they were trying to fix the problem and kept us on board. This I feel was a lie as it so happened that they let the 100 + passengers off as the last flight to London departed. We then had to stand around for 2 Hours trying to get rescheduled onto the next day flight and hotel accommodation which even though they knew we were coming had not prepared anything. Next day we flew home on the aircraft that we had originally taken off in. I would not recommend BA at present, even the new A380 I flew on to LA had so many faults and badly thought through. I will miss the easy access of Terminal 5 and lounges that I earned through loyalty as many other customers do. However the age, quality of the aircraft along with the new bullish attitude of customer care has lost me as a customer.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am a regular user of BA and generally find the airline to be OK but not outstanding. This flight was fairly full , departed on time and check in was very quick. In my opinion the 747 fleet of BA needs either replacement of extensive refurbishment, these aircraft are all old and look it in the interior. The seats were past their prime and quite uncomfortable. The food offering was very poor, no fresh items either at dinner or for breakfast. Staff were OK, punctuality was good and baggage delivery although not fast was acceptable. Inflight entertainment was good but the TV screens are from a previous age with quite poor quality: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The flight left on time and arrived early, which was great. The B747-400 fleet of BA needs either replacement or complete refit of the interiors. The aircraft was old and looked it. The food was pretty standard but compared with our earlier Cape Town to London flight much better and more complete, why the lack of consistency is unclear. The inflight entertainment offering is good but the TV screens are small and worn delivering poor quality images. Staff were excellent, efficient and friendly and went out of their way to make the journey more pleasant: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The outgoing flight was fine, the return flight was cancelled due to an issue with the plane. I understand this happen as I am a seasoned traveller, however what happened next was unacceptable and what you would expect from a low class airline. We were handed tickets for an American Airlines flight from a different O'Hare terminal and told \"you have to go now\". The terminal was in chaos and travelling from the international terminal to terminal three took one hour. Getting boarding passes and going again through security was another hour or so but the flight was delayed and left two hours late. Flight was very mediocre and not what I had paid for with BA. We arrived in London and guess what - no bags, even though we spent more than 5 hours in Chicago Airport and were assured our bags were on the flight. That was Sunday now it is Tuesday, no on has contacted us and no updates.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The seat that I had booked 24 hours in advance (a window seat) had been changed without my consent to the middle of the cabin, I complained to the staff at the gate and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the flight was full. Once onboard I discoverd that the interior was worn and the seats very uncomfortable. The in-flight entertainment or the VOD (video on demand) system apeared to be VHS and was broken for my seat, one of the cabin crew had to do a reset it which took over ten minutes. The screen was very pixelated and the sound did not work very well which meant that watching the in-flight entertainment was more tiring than not watching it. The food was average but seemed to match the aircraft as it was dull and tasteless. As this was an overnight flight I expected to be able to get somewhat more than a 30 min nap which was interupted, any sleep was not possible due to the fact that there was 5 infants in the world traveller cabin all of which at least 3 were shrieking at any given time. The Boeing 777 should not be still used on long haul flights as it does not live up to the standards of BA's Airbus A380's or Boeing 747 flights. I had an excellent flight out on BA and an amazing stay in Washington D.C but the flight back put a dent in the enjoyment of the holiday.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA shorthaul Business Class is now nothing more than a con. The seat is the same size as in Economy, barely 29 inch seat pitch, so no extra legroom for the extra money being paid. The middle seat is blocked, but they then go and stick a table in it making it not only hard to get in and out of the window seat, but also no thought to emergency evacuation situations as it is alomst impossible to collapse the seat down - it took 3 FAs when I asked them and almost 10 minutes. Why does BA put these awful tables in? Nobody uses them and when I complained to BA, I was told \"don't sit in a window seat\" - what sort of Customer Relations is that. Never again BA Business Class shorthaul for me, I have flown many years with them including holding a FF Gold Card for 3 years and numerous Silver Cards. As I said at the beginning - nothing more than a con.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "What has happened to BA in recent years? It has been a long time since I ventured onto their long haul flights, and after this trip I will steer very clear again and stay with Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines. Airport service in Narita is always good - because it is not BA providing the service. But for the rest of the trip, simply awful. The seats (that were introduced back in the era of the only BA boss to improve things) are cramped, claustrophobic and very unpleasant on a long haul flight. Because of the seat design, there is an economy class meal style service rather than the table service that most of the \"good\" airlines now offer in Business class. The cabin staff were frankly laughable, sadly with the exception of a charming and attentive Japanese FA. British Airways is trading off a very distant reputation, and it seems that most British customers select them simply because they are British - anyone that travels a reasonable amount will know that BA is now well down the quality list, and it is about time Skytrax downgraded them to 3-Star Airline maximum - they do not meet 4-Star. BA markets itself as this slick, British style, when the reality is that they are a substandard member of oneworld now, and should be avoided if you have a proper choice of airline - many UK companies and UK departments stipulate BA as a No 1 choice, and frankly they are throwing their money down the pan. If you're proud to be British, I would recommend you give BA a wake-up call and avoid this very poor airline until they wake up and improve standards. As a closing point, I recently travelled China Southern Airlines on my outbound sector to Guangzhou, and they are streets ahead of BA in almost every element, excepting some language skills.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After 7 flight changes we took off to LHR which I was pleased about given that so many of the shuttles our friends have tried to travel on have previously just been cancelled. The aircraft from LHR had seen better days and I did wonder if we were in PE given other airlines we had travelled with. I would say categorically that it was not worth the extra hike. Just book economy with extra leg room. Given we used BA's partner airline AA which was awful and given the chap next to me had his family flight to Canada cancelled by BA and had to go a day early, via NY, I would never book with BA. Staff on board were excellent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to New York JFK is the most profitable route for British Airways. My ticket cost nearly £5,000 return. I fly fortnightly between London and New York JFK. The aircraft are tired, food is poor, even the new gourmet business class food. British Airways management should try the breakfast porridge with salt and blueberries! What about the afternoon tea sandwiches? Yuk. Toilets often out of service and on my last 6 flights at least 1 of the toilets has been out of service. The last flight BA117 on Wednesday 2 September 2015 the power failed meaning all the seats in my section of business class had to be manually positioned. The in-flight entertainment system stopped. The staff were great, but frankly all the company is doing is putting staff in a difficult position. In 2015 my company will have spent £120k on travel to and from London and New York. Too much money for such a mediocre service, aircraft that are many years beyond proper serviceability and a management team focused on shareholder profit not customer satisfaction. What a fall from grace. In August I flew Singapore Airlines London to Melbourne. What a difference in aircraft quality, customer service experience and value for money. Please British Airways, sort yourselves out. Letters to Keith Williams or Willie Walsh are ignored or intercepted by staff. Lots of promises and little or no action. My most recent cabin was held together by pipe insulator. The last one the same, and horrible condensation issue with the air con resulting in a soaked blanket at take off.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Compared to the likes of EVA Air or Qatar Airways, British Airways Club World is by far the poor relation. Flew from Glasgow to New York via LHR, the seats have zero storage apart from the small drawer at floor level. It is astonishing that for the money they charge, you have to step over the legs of the person on your outside, especially if you accidentally trip and land on top of them. Food was satisfactory although a small bacon roll for breakfast was again a poor show. AVOD was also satisfactory. Apart from the flat bed, this just really doesn't have a premium feel about it. On our recent trip, on both legs, the crew were excellent, but the product from our national flag carrier simply is not worth the premium prices they charge.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Excellent British Airways flight from Heathrow to Johannesburg. My second flight on the A380 which smooth, quiet and very comfortable.

Boarding quick however the use of a bus to a remote stand always feels odd at an airlines hub newish aircraft with new Club Europe seating first time using this layout and must say felt not much different to economy. Flight away on time, service ok with english breakfast on offer. Crew ok. Landed a little early. Return check in quick and easy although 3rd party lounge is just ok, flight departed on time lasting 2hr 35min, crew pretty nice and the old CE layout on this A320 appeared comfier, afternoon tea served which was ok. Flight arrived a little late but on to a stand so no bus trip. I'm unsure if Club in Europe is still worth the extra, I have a few more BA European flights coming up so will judge once I've used economy and club once more.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Dubai in British Airways First Class. The trip got off to a good start with the Concorde lounge at Terminal 5. Very comfortable and private, however showing signs of wear and tear. Needs a bit of a refurb. Boarding was announced and we promptly left, however only just made it to the gate. (Very odd, but I am no fan of the trains to the strange satellite terminals for boarding.) The plane was a very old refurbished Boeing 747-400. Quite why BA hangs on to these gas guzzlers is a mystery. I estimate the plane, over its life so far, has done about 90 million miles (enough to get to the moon). Much criticism has been said about cramming so many First suites into the nose of the plane, and I can say that is fully justified. It was a day flight so not worried about sleeping, but if it were a night flight as a tall (but not overweight) man I would struggle to get comfortable. It’s like a coffin and storage space for personal effects not worth a light. A cabin crew told me they will hang on to the newer Boeing 747-400s for another 5-10 years. If so, this is truly unbelievable. Given the Emirates competition on this route, their fantastic suites and they always serve caviar, one does wonder if the sales and marketing people at British Airways have a clue how to entice customers to the overall experience. There is so much criticism of British Airways on this site, one wonders why they don’t listen. It can only be perceived as arrogance. Food was fine. Very nice mezza, nice soup and spicy Middle Eastern style chicken; not bad at all. Champagne very basic and Krug has long vanished from British Airways routes. Cabin crew were terrific – faultless. Travelling a Boeing 777 on the way back. Hopefully a better seat.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Brussels to Heathrow with British Airways. Lounge at Brussels very acceptable. Plenty of space. Reasonable snacks (I wouldn’t call it a 'meal'.) Plane pushed back on time and we were airborne in minutes. The flight to LHR was just 40 minutes and straight in without stacking – landing from the East. Barely enough time for a meal, but a number of passengers took advantage of the reasonable looking prawn salad. I was happy with a couple of gin and tonics. Seated in row one, so leg room was okay in the strange “new” Club Europe seats. Overall not bad.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "On the upper deck on BA 282 (Aug 31st), although the equipment is relatively new, once you are in those hideous seats, you wouldn't be aware of what aircraft you are on. Squeezing as many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a premium cabin experience. British Airways missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product, but while other carriers improved their cabins, BA seem content in leading the race to the bottom. The crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. The child's parents were certainly mare tolerant than I would have been. Crew turned a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still climbing and the seat belt signs were still illuminated. Once the food was served, crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast was served. Due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip, I ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offerings were on this sector. The 'Club Kitchen' is a complete waste of time. I did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight (after negotiating the outstretched legs of a sleeping passenger) but the unlabeled sandwiches were chilled out of their existence and were inedible. British Airways really need to up their game in respect of offering a premium cabin service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of \"pasta or chicken\" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight. This was definitely the last flight with British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Thoroughly disappointed with this supposed legacy airline. Having been delayed for an hour on my British Airways connecting flight to LHR and stuck overnight at a Heathrow hotel I was looking forward to getting going on the morning flight. Reality check. This aircraft is old and decrepit and was built in the 80s, it should have been retired long ago. A quick Google search shows that this aircraft makes up the majority of BA's longhaul fleet. The seats are so small and narrow that you are constantly playing elbow hockey with the people on either side of you. I am 5ft 8 and weigh 70kg so how a larger person might survive is beyond me. Everything is old and looks it too. Even the staff. The seats are worn to the point that you can feel every piece of the metal frame beneath. In fact the lady seated in front of me complained to the cabin crew because she could feel the miniature Tropicana bottle I had put the seat pocket. Even the safety animation video looks like it was made as a school IT project by 11 year olds. Staff are cold and unfriendly, it would seem that their contracts forbid smiling of any kind. The inflight entertainment screens are smaller than a regular smartphone and have large visible pixels, it is a struggle to actually see what is being displayed. They are running on brand image only and even then there's only fumes left in tank. Do not fly BA at least until they seriously upgrade their fleet.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Plane was clean, staff amiable and present with deliveries of juice and water through the flight. Dinner on departure was fine, maybe a little dry but otherwise tasty enough.  The seatback screen was tiny but selection of entertainment was good. The picture quality was rather poor. The black mark was the pathetic breakfast - croissant was inedible. Partly frozen, tasteless and it seemed like most of the folk seated nearby did not even open the plastic wrapper. Two cups of tea and a muesli bar was ample. My wife and I were travelling on different itineraries with British Airways and this was one flight we shared. I asked 3 times for the agent to link the booking, which she did. BA computer did not perform properly so we were seated apart. No drama since the plane was only about 80% full and we sorted it out ok. This was part of a round the world ticket, so I have no idea on the \"value for money\" question for this sector.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-BKK-LHR. Started badly with all the Ryanairesque baggage warnings at Terminal 5. BA's low 23kg baggage allowance had me nervy. Seating offered less legroom than competitors and seat not very comfy. Outward food superb, best economy meal I've had in a long time. Return trip horrible. At check-in I was under 30kg but over the 23kg derisory BA limit. Was asked for £65 more but declined. When I quoted Thai Airways 30kg limit I was invited to buy a ticket with them. So I had to put on loads of clothes and dump a few cheap items to get my boarding pass. On the plane I had to sit next to a very fat man (not BAs fault) and the food was disgusting. Some rubber chicken with four strips of gravy-sodden potato wedges. No vegetables. Second meal only accompanied by tasteless square of sponge. No salad, yoghurt or other goodies. Between the 2 meals a goody box was given out with an oat bar and a few other bits which was nice. IFE had the smallest screen I have ever seen, and a poor choice of films. Return flight journey progress constantly broke down. Generally, a poor experience considering BA's prices. Will not be using BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have not got as far as even flying with British Airways this time around, and the customer service are a nightmare. Sent an email with flight confirmation and agreed time to us, yet a later email tells us different time. They say we need to take it up with Vueling, their sister company - call Vueling and are told it is a British Airways issue. None of them will take responsibility for changing our flight times without asking. It's now too late to get an alternative flight at a reasonable price, so have to return at a stupid time in the morning which has ruined our anniversary weekend break. No compensation or anything. Horrible, greedy company who thankfully are in decline. Pay a bit more and fly with genuine 4 or 5 star airlines. About 3 levels below Cathay Pacific and the rest around that price bracket.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LHR-PHX 16 Sept. Last few times I've flown British Airways, I'd been forced to consider BA as a discount airline that doesn't deserve its 4 star rating, and I was not looking forward to this flight. We had awful seats at the back of a very full plane so asked at bag drop about upgrades. Paid £230 each to go up to WTP (a bargain when added to the price we paid for our seats in coach) and it was worth it! Does anyone know why we check in online or go to a self-serve kiost but still have to go to bag drop to pretty much go through the check in process again? Boarding went as usual, smiley welcome aboard and to our seats. This aircraft had WTP immediately behind First. Good leg room, comfortable seat, small cabin of its own. A small amenity pack is provided, although most of the stuff in it is inferior and hardly worth having. Only one FA worked our cabin but he was friendly and efficient and the lack of more staff was not noticable. Drinks trolley and lunch menus then food served. Lunch with 2 options, china plates, real cutlery, napkins etc.  Food was very good, even though only one option left by time we were served. Had beef, which was tasty and tender and well presented. A snack box was passed out a few hours later and dinner served 2 hours before landing. Interestingly, dinner was from economy. Foil dish, plastic cutlery, paper napkins. Given the price of WTP ticket, would have expected better then that.  Only one juice/water round but FAs were in the galley and happy to get whatever you wanted (until we drank tham out of bubbles!). Being an older plane, the IFE was ancient with a very small screen that had grid lines showing and a barely adequate movie selection. Noise cancelling headset was not the best and hurt my ears. IFE was only a minor irritation, as flight was scheduled 10 hours 45 and I was more interested in comfort, which WTP provided. Only real gripe is the tray table. It folds out of the seat arm as a drinks tray, then unfolds to a full tray. Problem is, drinks slide off when in small mode and you have to brace the full tray on your knees to stop your dinner sliding off. British Airways is relying on its past reputation rather than providing a good product these days and I avoid them if I can because of that. I didn't think I would be saying this but I enjoyed this flight and it was probably the best BA flight I've had. A shame then that I will still avoid British Airways if I can.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Have just returned on British Airways from St Lucia and enjoyed the flight in Club World on the return journey. Cabin crew, especially the purser made the trip very comfortable. Tasty dining and free flowing drinks. A safe and comfortable flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Excellent Club Europe service. I am amazed how European carriers serve so much to it's business class passengers for such a short flight compared with North American airlines business class. Champagne, delicious afternoon tea, and superior service made this short 2 hour flight perfect in business class. Great business class lounge in Marseille for business class passengers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Our night flight was delayed by nearly an hour; not the fault of the airline but a contributory factor to our disappointment with BA on this flight (17th June 2015). We paid extra for our Premium Economy tickets, then extra again to reserve seats, and past experience with BA and with equivalent seats/service on Virgin Atlantic had led us to expect value for money and some small rewards for the extra costs. Not this flight, however, where the only real benefit appeared to be a small amount of extra legroom. We were last to board after First, Business and Economy. Where customers in Premium Economy used to be greeted with the choice of a glass of fizz or orange juice, now it is water or juice. Once we had taken off, drinks were served; fine, but when the steward came to collect the empty glass/bottle, he knocked the glass onto the floor, where it broke - the staff were all rushed and seemed to be short on numbers perhaps? I was made to feel that the breakage was my fault! Dinner did not arrive until after 11pm, by which time I had rather lost interest, as had my partner. So far, our extra costs had bought us extra leg room and one glass of wine (I was not offered a second, possibly because of my crime of causing the steward to break a glass). Overnight, by contrast to other night flights, the lights were never fully dimmed; there were no offers of water/orange juice to prevent dehydration. The promised (on the menu card) morning 'light snack' and coffee/tea/fruit juice was a hastily delivered piece of dried-up cake and a weak coffee - no mention of fruit juice. I couldn't really see what my extra costs were getting me that those in Economy had for less - the extra leg room was rather negated by the passenger in front's fully reclined seat. I will not, if at all possible, be travelling with BA again. It left a rather sour taste at the end of our holiday.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check in at Tegel was a disaster and ludicrously (for it has a lot of BA flights) I was told there are no BA staff at that airport to sort out problems. 100 minutes prior to departure, 2 check in desks were open - 1 business, 1 economy. As a BA Silver card holder, I joined the business queue. First one lady had considerably too much baggage. The arguments went on for more than 10 minutes before she paid the extra fees. Then the technical crew for a pop event the previous day had to be checked in. Not only were some of their 20 or so items very overweight, others were way too large. After 20 more minutes I asked a young lady why the other business passengers could not be processed at the economy desk. This was not possible, I was told. Eventually another economy desk opened; yet our queue remained immobile for a further 15 minutes. Finally after more than 40 minutes, someone decided we could be processed at an economy desk after all! Looking forward to a drink in the lounge, I then discover there is no lounge airside. As for the LHR-ORD flight, I have been spoiled with business class intercontinental travel since business class was introduced. To board an international carrier and discover a seat pitch of just 31\" was a major shock. This is like travelling long haul on a budget carrier only at considerably greater cost. The worst part was the cabin was kept at an extremely warm temperature throughout despite requests for the captain to reduce it to a more reasonable level. The meal was OK and the IFE had a decent selection of movies. But overall, the flight was hugely uncomfortable. With some other carriers still offering a seat pitch greater than 31\", BA has lost my future business.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After my flight to Vienna with BA I was hoping for a slight improvement on the way back - however the service was very boring. Drink service was rushed with the stewardess pouring an entire miniature of vodka into a drink before putting a drop of Tomato juice in when I asked for a Tomato and Vodka - unpalatable. Was glad to be off the plane in all fairness. Hoping that one day BA will wow me.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Slightly disappointing flight in an aircraft that was showing it's age. It seems very little effort is put into cabin decor meaning it looks quite tawdry in all fairness. Food was okay - ham and cheese croissant - but nothing to write home about. Seats weren't great for someone my height and all in all I was left feeling underwhelmed - budget level offerings at a high price: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First time travelling in a premium class so compared with Economy it was great. Check-in at LHR was quick and we were grateful of the additional baggage allowance in Club Europe. The fast track through security was also welcome. The Galleries Lounge in T3 was excellent, we were welcomed and given a quick overview of the lounge. The breakfast in the lounge offered everything from cereal to pastries to hot sandwiches, as well as tea, coffee, juice, water and a wide selection of alcohol. There was also a great view of the runway which my son enjoyed. The service on board the flight itself offered hot towels prior to take off, then a full English Breakfast with real cutlery and plates, warm bread rolls and choice of drinks. The legroom was excellent and the seat was comfortable. They are laid out in the same 3x3 configuration as Economy but the middle seat has a table over it which gives you extra room to place your items. As you are near the front of the plane, disembarkation was quick and we were at the carousel before our cases. The return journey was much the same, and although the lounge at BCN did not offer anywhere near such a good selection of food, the seating was far superior to LHR. The meal on the way back was a selection of Spanish meats with, cheese, olives and a spicy mousse, together with the usual selection of drinks. We were able to use the Fast Track through passport control at LHR which avoided a long queue and meant we were out of the airport and in our car within an hour. Overall this was a fantastic experience for me and my family who usually travel in Economy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I wish I could comment on the service on the aircraft, but with a 27 hour delay I am unable to and can only comment on the ground service after being informed the aircraft was delayed because of a technical fault. It is not the technical fault I am worried about but the way the problem was handled by BA's ground staff at Johannesburg's OR Tambo Airport. The cabin crew had arrived at 18.00hrs and boarded the plane which was due to depart at 19.20hrs to London. At 18.20hrs the announcement came that the flight was not boarding and passengers should wait to be escorted to the arrivals areas to collect baggage. The chaos then started. People close to the boarding desks sought to find out information and the possibility of alternative flights (which were fully booked). After about 40 minutes passengers were told to go to arrivals where BA staff would be there to assist. Got to arrivals, nobody was there to even tell passengers which carousel to go to. A series of late announcements then informed passengers to collect luggage and go to the arrivals area to seek hotel vouchers. Nobody was directing passengers at each stage. Passengers were congregating under an electronic sign that said South African Airways domestic transfers to collect vouchers. The line slinked back into the arrivals area. Only two service agents were dealing with all passengers. Chaotic scenes. No line for families or premium passengers. In the end no vouchers were given and free for all to just know which hotel to go to. No clear announcements given at any stage to passengers. All airlines have issues which mean a plane will be cancelled - it is how the issue is dealt with that shows professionalism and a basic duty of care to passengers. In this case there was nobody in charge, nobody undertaking line management and nobody providing one source of information. A true shambles. Passengers arrived at the hotel not knowing when the aircraft would leave (scheduled to leave 27 hrs after original departure) or what the real problem was (rumours only). Flying Club and having a BA Gold Card (with Gold List status) meant nothing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Pretty poor experience flying with BA. Staff were not enthusiastic about taking care of passengers, food portions were insufficient, online check in was a problem. BA was able to process my payment for upgrading seats, but once they took my money, the website stopped working and no longer let me select seats or check-in. BA is more expensive than Virgin Atlantic, and delivers worse service. Virgin allows passengers to pick their seats on booking, BA charges passengers for that option. I've booked 60 tickets on transatlantic flights over the past 5 years - BA, Virgin, Delta and by far the best experience was Virgin/Delta. I wont be booking BA - not very good value for money: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Boarding delayed in MIA due to weather but BA kept passengers updated. On boarding, offered drinks and FA's welcomed passengers. After take-off, staff took meal order and came around with drink trolley. FA's checked on passengers and made sure if everyone was comfortable. Food at a high standard and filling. Entertainment system a bit outdated but movies very new. The seat was comfortable, but since it was a rear-facing seat it made the take-off a bit odd. LHR-BRU excellent service.

      "Our return flight from Barbados to England was delayed by 25 hours. The experience at the airport was dreadful - initially told that we would be updated every 15 minutes (that was the only update!) stuck airside with no food (all food outlets and shops shut), a free for all when some bottles of water arrived. Inability of BA ground staff to communicate with immigration (a walk of about 6 feet or a phone call), chaos when trying to give immigration cards back to hot, tired, thirsty and hungry passengers. The positive in all this was being put up in a hotel. Again - lack of communication. I was never contacted directly - people in the group were updated by BA on twitter. great if you have internet/twitter.  Despite putting in a claim from BA for flight delay I have not yet had a response from a human being. Not sure re star ratings - this site does not appear to let me put a Zero star rating.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight was picked because it got us from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to Newcastle, UK in a reasonable amount of time. What BA failed to inform anyone was that despite advertising the flight from RUH to LHR as landing at 5.25am BST at LHR is that planes cannot land at LHR before 6am. So once landed and they taxied to the apron we had little time to get through transit to catch the Newcastle flight. We made it and got to Newcastle only to find that our two suitcases were there but my golf bag which I had paid for did not make that flight. It did make the next flight to Newcastle but I had already had to set off to make an appointment some 170 miles from Newcastle. It took 3 days for my golf bag to arrive at where I was staying. Not one word of apology from BA. The seats on the flights were ok, service of crew satisfactory, the headsets didn't work from RUH to LHR and I tried three sets. Best part was the hot bacon sandwich between LHR and NCL.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been a long time supporter of BA, but they have successfully managed to degrade the economy product to such an appalling level that I suspect that US based carriers now offer a better product. From ridiculously expensive fees to book seats in advance, to child-sized low quality meals on board, to planes on our route that only offer the dense 3-3-3 configuration, and new policies limiting the amount of Avios you can earn with economy tickets, I have had enough. My partner and I left both the transatlantic flight to LHR from PHL, as well as the LHR to TXL flight absolutely starving. A very sad state of affairs for BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow Bag drop with no queue and friendly staff. Boarded the aircraft and left on schedule. I found the leg room and width fine for my 6'1\" frame. Not over spacious but comfortable for a 3 hour flight. Aircraft was clean and seemed pretty new. Certainly a step up from the rather tired 777 and 747s BA uses on long haul routes. A bit of food and drink served by friendly staff helped pass the time until our on time arrival. Efficient, punctual and comfortable.  Return flight was equally smooth. I have flown with BA and BEA over the last half century and can't see the deterioration that many complain about. The staff are not perhaps the same as they used to employ, but customer demographics would also not be the same.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I used British Airways Club Europe from LGW to Naples. Basically the flight is the same as long haul economy except no entertainment and the middle seat is left empty? As far as I can tell there is no difference in legroom and seats are identical to economy. I'm not sure how British Airways can pass this off as Business class.  My advice if booking a business class flight in Europe, look at competitors otherwise book economy and save the money. Only really good thing about flight was an amazing cabin staff that looked after us really well.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Kos return. Outbound the Galleries South lounge looking shabby. Onboard, cramped seats (2D/F), disinterested cabin crew and appalling breakfast. Return there no lounge at Kos airport, slow busing to plane, attentive crew and good lunch. Both flights on schedule and baggage return reasonably quick. A case of two halves, but the new British Airways Club Europe is poor value.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I fly about 1-2 times a month, 90% of the time with British Airways. I'm not sure what is going on with British Airways, but their service is just getting worse and worse. You can see the individuals are trying, but it seems the business just doesn't want them to be able to deliver that world class First service they owned for all those years. I can only assume it's about cost cutting as their planes are so dated and falling to bits now. Especially when you compare it other airlines like Cathay or American Airlines. In all honesty, if you can fly an alternate airline, you'll probably get a better first class cabin and cheaper - I'd recommend it. Also, how does this airline not have Wifi on their long haul yet? Once a pioneer of the air world. British Airways is now a half dead dinosaur with no real sense of direction.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I am a very regular traveller with British Airways, and I am currently Executive Club Gold/Oneworld Emerald. I have recently flown with a heap of other Oneworld Airlines and feel British Airways service slipping rapidly. The crew are smiles when you enter the cabin, but when you are served, the smiles seem a bit absent, and the service, I would describe as passable. Compared with Cathay Pacific where crew will approach the Premier Status customers with a full welcome (regardless of class) and give that extra special attention making you feel of value, this is absent with British Airways. Still the flight was short and pleasant enough. I got Exit seat and the legroom was very good, not very good in the standard economy seat and being 1.87m its a squeeze. But all that you need for a 2 hour flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London City to Granada. I've flown with BA a lot over the years, most recently in Business and First and have, until recently, always had a favourable opinion of them. I recently used Avios to take a short break to Granada with my brother. My normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because I don't believe the extra cost (whether this be actual money or Avios) justifies the perceived benefits. Regrettably, no economy reward seats were available so I opted for Club Europe. The only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip! So what did we get for our 'business' flights no lounge at City Airport, no fast track at City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. Seats in Club Europe are identical to those in Economy. The breakfast going out was terrible (burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant). The lunch (if you can call it that) coming back was also terrible - a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track at Granada, coupled with a single check-in desk most of the time and long queues I complained to BA about this - the initial response was that Club Europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to check the aircraft, as there is no middle seat on the Embraer - it's a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. After some considerable persistence on my part, a partial refund of 5,000 Avios each was provided by British Airways. I recently had the choice of flying Club World to Hawaii (BA to LAX and then AA to HNL) but given the fact that British Airways Club World can be quite claustrophobic, ultimately decided to try out Qatar Airways new business class to Thailand (via Doha) - by all accounts their business class is comparable to British Airways first class. I shall review this some time next year!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Cape Town and the British Airways bag drop and ground staff service was great. Onboard, the evening meal was fine, but the inflight entertainment choices are very poor. Films, TV and music choices are limited. Cabin crew were courteous and served one drink and then dinner - but no more service after that. Overnight no water was offered, we had to keep getting up to go and ask, and then only got small measures not bottles. Breakfast choice was fair but the food was awful! Luke warm gunge, cheap cereal, tepid tea - truly not worth bothering with. I believe this is usual as my brother had similar experience a month ago flying business class from Mexico. I will think twice about booking British Airways again if I have a choice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Cape Town with British Airways. I was aware that the 747 is past it's best but I had two wonderful flights due mainly to the superb service from cabin crew, who are better than any other airline I have travelled. I did however have maybe the best seats ie 28b and 28j in the entire economy section which give unlimited legroom and a speedy exit. The food was extremely good with dinner and breakfast served. The toilets were spotless.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Gatwick to Las Vegas return, both flights both on time. On the outward flight, we were served sparkling wine before departure, on the return only juice and water were offered. Each flight included two meals of acceptable quality, although small portions. Soft drinks were provided at intervals during the flight. This Premium Economy cabin now feels outdated, with no at-seat power, and a very small IFE screen. The best part was the larger seat and extra room, which made a big difference to comfort. Flight attendant service was professional.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The British Airways Club Europe (Business) product is dreadful value for money. The lounge in Geneva airport was fine but busy as previous flights had been delayed. Boarding wasn't done by priority, just a free for all at the gate - fine but nothing special. My real issue is with the offering on-board: no special seats, just the middle seat of three left free. We were then served a 'meal' of a few lettuce leaves, two tomatoes, two bits of cheese and a piece of chicken - really BA? To top it off we were on a remote stand at Heathrow and it took a long time to get the transfer bus to us. Just not worth it on every level.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Refusing to pay £73 pp to reserve seats in Business Class (a stunt more worthy of Ryanair) I checked in two passengers online 20 minutes after online check in opened only to find that one seat was in row 7 and the other in row 11. There was no option to change seats and no phone contact given. I tried to phone the British Airways Kuala Lumpur office but the number given would not connect. I then went to the BA Office listed in Kuala Lumpur only to find it had been closed and moved to another location in Ampang Park. Still having asked several people no one knew of a BA office. Arriving at the airport I was told the flight was full but a change of seats might be possible once on board, which proved to be the case. But I then found myself next to a family with three very small children. Although the parents did what they could to amuse the children it was always going to difficult during a 13 hour flight. It was a long night and a very difficult flight. The sight of young children in nappies wandering around is not what I expected in business class. All in all it was a flight in flying nursery which I would rather forget. I now know why other reviewers on this site have used the acronym BA - Better Avoid. Business class beware.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having flown on an Emirates and Thai A380 I had high hopes for a great experience on British Airways. Not so. The lounge in Johannesburg was packed and the space in general was claustrophobic. Onboard I am used to personalised greetings and warm smiles with a glass or two of fine champagne within minutes of arriving. It took BA cabin crew until the final seconds of boarding to offer any drinks, and they certainly disappeared before a second drink could be requested. Business configuration is far from personal with someone sitting directly opposite you. Seats are extremely uncomfortable for what is business class. At meal time a member of cabin crew came and kicked closed a drawer that was part of my seat. No decorum at all. I have had better service on easyjet. Very difficult to sleep as the person adjacent to the seat in front of mine had to climb over my legs to get out into the aisle. Terrible. No way BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. My return flight did not start well. 45 minutes queing to check-in. After that though, the flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early. Thankfully there were seats by one of the overwing exits which were empty, so I was asked if I'd move forward. I was happy to do so. Like most European airlines, food is minimal; a small bun filled with chicken and bacon plus a dry cake with mocca flavoured icing. Exactly the same snack was provided on the outbound flight. I avoided alchol and stuck with an orange juice. The aircraft was an old ex BMI model (which I'd been on twice before), so it lacks the new seating, which is no bad thing. My checked bag arrived on the carousel 20 mins after landing (just as I got there), which was a bonus. All in all, an OK flight but I'd seek alternatives in future if the prices and timings were similar.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "There are many negative reviews on this site - its almost embarrassing to admit to flying BA. I am adding another one. I have flown BA on/of for 37 years. I guess that makes me qualified to write a review. My main gripe is the total lack of value for money. The erosion of quality and services and the sky rocketing prices. This flight from Heathrow to Barcelona and the return - accentuates the lack of value. Barcelona flights operates out of Terminal 3 at LHR. Quite why BA use this ageing and outdated terminal is a mystery. You walk miles and if you are unfamiliar with this point, as we were, - you end up running a panicked race to the gate. Its worse on arrivals. Immigration and passport control was a zoo.  The T3 Business lounge is mediocre, Plastic tables and chairs. The most awful selection of dried out bacon baps and dried out omelettes stuffed into baguettes. The seating areas overlooking the airport was cluttered with newspapers. There was plenty of booze. Flight left on time. The meal inflight I could not be bothered with. FAs all fine. On the return the shared lounge was surprisingly good. More comfortable than T3 at LHR. Ageing plane. Mediocre afternoon tea. Frumpy FAs who \"forgot\" to hand out our Fast Track tickets to help speed up through immigration. (We got held up for half an hour.)  On both flights we had to endure the silly Club Europe seats - basically two seats - with the middle seat closed down into a table. Cramped leg room. Definitely no value here. I only fly BA when I have to. It really needs a clean out of the management and a new team with some vision on how to make British Airways a world leader - which right now they fail miserably to achieve, in all their cabins.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Gatwick to Catania, Sicily return as part of package tour of Sicily. Outward journey was very cramped, staff were unhelpful and the light afternoon snack was served in a cardboard box. One round of drinks very hurriedly served. Return flight was very similar but the staff were even worse, snack literally thrown at us and passengers told not to move until rubbish collected. No inflight entertainment provided.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outbound flight with British Airways from Gatwick to Orlando was good, chose seats at the back of the aircraft and ended up with 9 seats (3 rows) between five of us, so we could stretch out and relax. Food was surprisingly good, served chicken curry with basmati rice for lunch and a chicken caesar salad sandwich for afternoon tea. Plenty of choice of drinks and snacks available throughout the flight in the rear galley. Inbound flight was less good. Took the cabin crew over three hours to do the drinks and dinner service, leaving less than 3 hours to get some sleep prior to breakfast being served. My son's children's meal took nearly two hours to arrive by which time he was starving. Dinner was chicken with dumplings which tasted a lot better than it looked. Breakfast was very poor, a small croissant with jam and a granola bar. The crew seemed stressed and disorganised for the entire flight. The AVOD system is starting to look dated compared with other carriers, there are a limited number of programmes to watch and the audio selection is very small. BA need to look at upgrading this in line with some of the Asian carriers who are miles ahead in this respect. Seats were comfortable and legroom good. Overall I would fly BA again but they could certainly improve some aspects of their service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Shanghai to London Heathrow with British Airways. Excellent experience, the check-in and boarding was very efficient. Cabin crew friendly, efficient and professional. A slight departure delay was due to ATC China but we at arrived LHR on time. Round trip fare of GBP 549 is cheap.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Funchal. What has happened to BA club Europe? You used to get wider seats and more leg room than economy. Not any more. Same seats as economy but with middle seat blocked. Breakfast ok but not brilliant. Staff were good and I enjoyed the champagne but was it worth paying for club class? No it wasn't. We were lucky and got row 2 by the food galley which meant extra legroom but that was more luck than design. I wouldn't fly Club Europe again unless I was guaranteed this seat but to get it I would have to pay £18 per person each way on top of the club fares. Total rip off BA. Before we flew I was going to book British Airways to Bangkok. Based on this experience though I'll stick to EVA Air. Additionally the club lounge at Gatwick was dire. No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge. The tables were also filthy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We booked a flight from London City (LCY) to Geneva (GVA) for our summer holidays. The flight was early, at 7:10. We turned up at the airport to be met by a huge queue at check in. After waiting in that for half an hour we headed to security. The airport was packed with hardy any where to sit. After two hours it was time for our gate number to appear, but it didn't. A mere 5 minutes before the flight was scheduled to depart, with still no information we where panicking as we didn't know the gate number and we thought we were going to miss the flight. We found out the flight was in fact cancelled due to technical issues with the aircraft, which was in fact flying to Venice a few hours prior. Chaos followed after as we where met other passengers travelling with BA who also had their flight to Frankfurt cancelled. A huge crowd of people appeared at the help desk. Luckly we were rebooked onto a later flight which was also delayed by an hour.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew British Airways Club Europe, from London Gatwick to Malta International Airport. I don't know why we paid double the economy fare per person as the seats are exactly the same as economy class apart from the lavish table in the middle of the 2 seats. You get a blanket, a cushion and nicer food than economy and access to the lounge, which comes with my Barclays travel deal anyway. I enjoyed the food on the plane but my sisters friend who flew with us is a pescetarian which means she only eats fish and not meat, so the crew said that's no problem and gave her a disgusting baguette with tomato, but she didn't like it and there was no other choice for her. Complete waste of money but I loved the chocolate cake - the best I've had. To conclude the BA club Europe is a waste of money because the seats are exactly the same as economy class and your paying to travel in more comfort and luxury. The Club Europe seats are a joke.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Prague to Singapore via Heathrow with British Airways. Not a good experience flying BA. Will never book again. Website allowed me to book a connecting flight with only 1 hour 40 minutes to spare. This is not sufficient time if you have to change terminals and especially if you have kids. We did not miss our flight but we had to run fast to make it with 2.5 year old toddler. There are no airport strollers available so be prepared to carry your child. Crew below average, food was terrible and not enough of it. At both destinations they didn't deliver our stroller.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Phoenix to London Heathrow. I'm trying to research whether this is just the Phoenix route but this plane was ancient. The business class seats are dirty and ripped, the entertainment system is terrible and the lounge for first and business customers is embarrassing. BA are the only airline to fly to Phoenix direct from LHR, but they need a serious rethink about the poor standards and condition of this plane. Next time I will fly a different airline and transfer via Chicago or Dallas.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Barcelona to London Heathrow. While the 767 is getting a little tired it was good to board with two aisles and there is a better feeling of space. Luggage bins are a little smaller but a very good job done of making sure larger \"carry on\" was sent in checked. Service was good and it's nice to get a cupcake and something to nibble.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Belfast with British Airways. Boarded about 12 noon for 12.55 take off. After some delay we were informed there was a technical fault and engineers had been called. We were offered water or soft drinks initially. We finally took off at 3pm which meant we had been sitting on the plane for 3 hours during which time we were not offered anything at all to eat. It was quite disgraceful for BA. Once airborne we were served tea / coffee / alcoholic drink and a choice of potato crisps. Is this what BA has been reduced to? This airline definitely no longer lives up to expectations and I will not be flying with them again. At least with low cost airlines you can at least buy some food.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have to be upfront and say the flight from London Heathrow to Boston exceeded expectations mainly due to the cabin crew. Over the years British Airways first has gone so far downhill I'm afraid it just can't compete anymore, it needn't be so as the issues as I see them are all resolvable. However, the return leg was like flying with Ryanair. There were only 13 people in the cabin. There were no slippers, 2 of the menu items I requested were, in the words of the crew \"invisible\", and what did arrive was verging on inedible due to sauce being lumpy and near to warm. The chocolate lava cake contained no lava and quite how one can burn and cool food at the same time is beyond me. My father waited the entire flight, having asked on 3 seperate occasions, for a headset convertor. We were not asked if we wanted to be woken for breakfast, which I then missed assuming I would be woken. There was a palpable tension between the crew, which was confirmed on leaving the flight when we overheard a member of the crew comment he was happier to get away from the crew than the passengers. Once we had disembarked the aircraft, it was a further 25 minutes before we could get in to the airport as a door had not been unlocked. Finally, we collect our suitcases, which I have to say were present when we arrived at baggage reclaim, only to find 2 of the 4 had broken wheels. BA have subsequently supplied 2 new replacement suitcases. When comparing the service / food to Virgin UC for USA and Etihad First for east bound, BA just doesn't cut the mustard any longer I'm afraid. Such as shame as the seats / bed are great, but why pay the extra £ for service and food that just isn't forthcoming or varies from flight to flight?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Manchester to New York via Heathrow. We were bumped off a BA connecting flight from Manchester to London Heathrow and put on an American Airlines B777-300 via LHR. Whilst I would agree that the staff on AA see passengers as a necessary evil (particularly as we were the lowest of the low in standard economy), the amount of room in their seat is by far a better option than those on the aging BA B747 aircraft. The food / drink served on the AA flight was also better than that served with BA. At least the coffee on AA came in coffee shop style cups, not the feeble paper cups that BA provided, with its 2 sips and it's gone drinks. I'm going to be booking a trip for our anniversary early next year to Boston, which I think I'll book with Icelandair, as this would avoid the 20 mins taxiing to the runway and 20 minutes circling time that.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Malta to London. First the plus points. Generous luggage and hand luggage allowance, even more so by being One World Sapphire member, which also allowed pre-booking of seats (including emergency exit row) at no charge and lounge access. So far so good, but new style leather seats (whilst smart looking) are hard after 3 hours flying without the ability to recline. No entertainment apart from BA in flight Magazine and inflight shopping magazine. What really lets British Airways down, though is the food and beverage service. One (albeit fresh) sandwich and a drink. No tea or coffee service and the crew fast became invisible after the meal had been served. The flight was crowded too, meaning that overhead luggage space was at a premium as the negative effects of a generous hand luggage policy came into play. On the basis of this trip, BA has declined significantly since I last flew with them, offering a very basic level of service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Philadelphia to London Heathrow with British Airways in First Class. Same issue as my last post. I buy a First ticket to relax after a hard week's work and BA has upgraded a family with small children, who eat takeout food in the lounge and disturb the cabin on the plane. This situation happens repeatedly, so travelling paid First Class on BA is a total wate of money. I can do the same trip on other airlines that value their premium passengers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "MAN to LHR with personable crew who did the breakfast service efficiently. Concorde Room fine and not too crowded on this Saturday morning. Smooth boarding with friendly reception and guide to seat. Experienced crew who interacted with passengers. Full cabin but service as expected, though initial drinks perhaps a little slow coming. Food fine as was selection of wines. Despite late departure arrived on time. A very relaxed and enjoyable journey - good service. Also very good fare from their sale last month.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Bucharest with British Airways. The flight was slightly delayed. I wasn't impressed with the boarding process. It was a full flight and most of the passengers carried more than one piece of cabin luggage. It took some time for passengers to find space to store the luggage and this slowed down the process. This also had an impact on the speed of getting off the plane when we arrived in Bucharest. They should have been stricter with the cabin luggage allowance. As it was a more than 3 hour flight, they served a hot meal. The food was not that good but enough to survive the 3 hour plus flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Shambolic check-in at New York JFK following the introduction of new computer system by British Airways. The long queues subsequently caused delays in flights to UK. Lots of managers milling around not doing anything useful. No attempt was made to keep passengers informed of the reason for the delays. The flight itself to London Heathrow was fine. BA's Business Class does what you would expect it to do, but there are few surprises or particular high points. Not a patch on the service by Cathy Pacific.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways standards have dropped dramatically. My flight from Heathrow to New York JFK was awful. Passengers were not given a hand towel or a menu before the dinner service. I was only given one choice of meal. The interior of the aircraft looked worn and shoddy (there was litter on the ground when entering the aircraft) with the onboard entertainment system on the aircraft outdated to say the least (there were limited choices available and the screen which was scratched kept flickering throughout the flight). Even the blanket and pillow looked as though it had had too many washes. The exterior of the aircraft was also dirty and unkept. Staff on board appeared far from athletic. British Airways are falling far behind the level of service provided by the top tier Far East and Middle Eastern airlines. Not impressed at all.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I'm extremely disappointed with British Airways and how their service has diminished. My daughter arrived at Milan airport today to catch a 6am flight to London Heathrow and then connecting to Mexico City. She is still at the airport after 12 hours. The fligth to London was cancelled. There was only one person at the counter in Milan and no employee told any of the passengers about the flight cancellation. Customers were furious, screaming at the lonely representative, because British Airways was not giving any answers or solving the problem. My daughter missed her flight, was not offered a meal, a hotel room and only given the option to fly with Iberia through Madrid and then connect to Mexico City. Her bag was sent to a distant belt and was never told she had to pick it up and retrieve her luggage. This has been a total disaster. I had also paid for a good seat on her long flight to Mexico City, and now I will have to write and complain and wait for a refund. British Airways was an excellent airline, until suddenly everything changed. On my last trip my bag never arrived at Heathrow, I was given a short connection time therefore I lost my next flight. I encountered a very rude lady at the customer service counter and I had to stay at Heathrow to get the same flight 24 hours later. I will never use them again until they improve or change their service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Quite simply next time we fly, and where possible, we shall use any other airline (with one exception being South African Airways) rather than British Airways. Flew from Johannesburg to London Heathrow. The seating in business on the A380 is dire and the description given by another reviewer that it feels as if you are in a coffin is pretty accurate. The staff were just about acceptable, but they appeared indifferent and just going through the motions of serving the food and beverages whilst trying not to look too bored whillst doing their job. Oh, and my TV packed up and froze, so I was unable to watch or listen to any music for half of the journey. The Qantas business class seating is superb and just how all the other airlines should configure their seating on the A380. Shame they don't fly to South Africa, although, if they did, it would be impossible to book a seat, as everyone would choose to fly with them and not British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight from Amsterdam to London in an Airbus 320, nothing special about this club europe, seats and legroom are similar to economy class, but they do not sell the middle seat in business, I would not buy a business class ticket for only club europe, it is not worth it. I do not understand why everyone is so excited about the lounge at T5, this is the third time I have been there, it was packed with families with screaming kids and you almost have to fight for a seat, that can not be the purpose of a business class lounge. Onboard we quickly found out that this was a very old plane, dirty carpet and torn upholstery on the seats. Food was poor, dirty cutlery that we had to keep if we wanted a dessert. I took a glass of wine with my dinner, when I asked for a second one I was told that they were out of that one, finally after fifteen minutes he came back with a new bottle. The crew did not make us feel that we were valued customers in business class. BA club world is not value for money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Glasgow to Kuala Lumpur via Heathrow. British Airways gets bashed a lot, and I get why - they don't have the best seat, they don't have the best food, they don't have the best cabins etc. They don't seem to be the best at anything! The Business Class lounges in LHR are often very busy, the food isn't very good, although they provide a load of free pouring alcohol.! The Club World cabin on the Boeing 787 is very nice place (although a bit crammed). The cabin design and atmosphere retains a feeling of class. In terms of the Club World seat, it has its critics, but I like it! The separate footrest is one of the best features for making a comfortable seating position, and its one of the only airline seats I can sleep in. This may in part be due to knowing there aren't many things to distract you from sleeping such as a bar area or a huge range of films on the IFE. Food wise, its an o' affair. The dishes are ok, although you only get the choice of dessert or cheese not both, how cheapskate! I have always found cabin crew to be experienced, highly competent and keen to help - they make the difference. I know when I get a BA flight I will be looked after, just not spoiled!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The flight from London City to Florence showed British Airways (well, Cityflyer in this case) at its best. The plane was spotless and reasonably new, the service was friendly and efficient and the food and wine were better than you would expect. It's worth noting that BA has no lounge at Florence and the business-class seating on board is identical with economy. But if you fly economy on a good day, this is pretty much as good as it gets for a short flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew from Frankfurt to London Heathrow on BA903. First everything went fine. Check In was quite fast and not very crowded and we didn't have such a long walk to the Gate. When we arrived at the Gate (D6) they told us our flight was delayed. Instead of 10.55 am, now 11.30 am departure time. The Aircraft arrived at 10.40 and boarding was at 10.55 (the planned departure time). Because the aircraft was parked at an apron position we had to go there by bus. The flight was OK but the aircraft hadn't been cleaned. They served crackers or crisps so there were crumbs everywhere around the cabin (from the last passengers). The seats were normal short haul seats and ok for a 1.30 hours flight. They told us the delay was because the baggage system in Heathrow collapsed. All in all the flight was OK.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from Leeds Bradford to London Heathrow. So much improved from my last flight with British Airways which was long haul. Cannot fault the airline in any way. Cabin Crew extremely friendly and chatty, when time permitted, and very helpful. Aircraft spotlessly clean, and very generous leg room. Of the three different airlines flown in this last week, BA wins hands down.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bengaluru to London Heathrow with British Airways in World Traveller. Started badly - at check-in and gate boarding World Traveller passnegers are made to feel second-class citizens, but this seemed worse at Bengaluru (choatic) than Heathrow. The plane itself was packed to capacity, probably because this is the only direct carrier on this route. World Traveller is a 3x3x3 configuration. I had chosen an aisle seat in the centre (seat 38D) at the rear to minimise risk of disturbance from other passengers. Leg room is actually pretty good for economy and the new style of seat has plenty of space underneath. Seat width is OK. The adjustable headrest is better than that in Premium Economy (World Traveller Plus) although the seat base is hard. For a 10 hour flight I recommend sitting on the cushion. Service was variable - the VOD in my seat did not work (all I could get was the map) and one of the staff reset it (quite grudgingly I felt) 3 times without success. Thankfully a more senior staff member was able to find the only other unoccupied seat about 3 hours after takeoff. To be expected to put up with a seat without VOD for 10 hours is ridiculous - why do BA not check them after each flight? Plenty of food (breakfast after 2hrs, in then a snack box after 5hrs, then lunch after 8hrs) but, unfortunately, while I thought sitting at the rear would mean being served first, that was not the case, and by the time they got to my row all choice was gone. No connectivity in seat, only earphone socket. VOD choice quite limited compared to other airlines. Unfortunately I think that British Airways have been overtaken these days and will look to the Middle and Far Eastern carriers in future.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After my positive post of the outbound journey, the return from Philadelphia to London Heathrow reminded me how inconsistent British Airways has become. Before boarding was told just 5 F passengers, but actually the cabin was full, presumably upgrades, though supposedly no other cabin overbooked - this really does downgrade the experience for fare paying passengers. Good greeting, though CSD never did speak to passengers as far as I could see. Sleeper suits and amenity pack on seat before we boarded, rather than the usual personal offer to each passenger. Pre- departure warm champagne served and that was the last drink I was offered, other than a bottle of water, until breakfast. Did not eat as had been told that, since this is a Sleeper Service, I should eat on the ground. Very little crew presence in the cabin during the night, and I was awake for a good part of it. Very poor value for money on this occasion.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Singapore to Sydney. Unfortunately, it was the poorest seating arrangement we have experienced in six different airline business class flights. We were face to face with a stranger and though the seats went flat for sleeping, they were too narrow. In addition, the flight attendants seemed to be disinterested. The BA business class lounge in Singapore was excellent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Everything about this British Airways flight from London Gatwick to Paphos was excellent, checked in at the airport the day before which took 5 minutes, on the day through fast track security in minutes and on to the lounge. Having read other reviews we must have struck lucky, we sat in the library which was an oasis of calm, the service at the bar was prompt and the food good, just as good as the old BA lounge if not better. Boarding was quick and efficient, took off a few minutes late, crew friendly and efficient, drinks service good and food, both choices tasty, landed on time and through passport and baggage within 20 minutes, a great start to our holiday.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very decent flight in business from Barcelona to Heathrow with British Airways. Extremely helpful and pleasant crew served a decent breakfast on this two hour hop which arrived Terminal 3. No transfer service for first class passengers to Terminal 5 where the security screening was insanely chaotic. Due to delays at security and the fact that all A380 flights leave from the B/C piers I had 10 minutes in the lounge. First class A380 service was fine but underwhelming compared to other carriers. Nice crew,but just decent food and service and no WI-FI.Not worth the money at all.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "St Lucia to Gatwick with British Airways. We checked in on line and dropped the luggage off and were quickly through security. The lounge was small but quite comfortable with a nice lady serving drinks at the bar. I asked her if she could make me a Rum Punch and despite causing a small queue, she happily made me an excellent cocktail. Boarding was well organised and the flight departed on time. On board we were extremely well looked - staff were very professional and were able to find the time to chat and make my wife and I feel very comfortable. The wine choices were explained very well with the offer of tasting each bottle. Dinner was plentiful if not that exciting but the numerous glasses of wine helped to make it was an enjoyable experience. We landed on time and after a brief scare from the pilot who said that due to the French air traffic controllers strike, there may be a delay in parking the plane, we soon disembarked and were in the luggage hall within around 25 minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were soon on our way home. Overall a very good flight thanks in main to the excellent cabin crew.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A mediocre service on this airline flying from London Heathrow to Stuttgart, which was to be expected given my prior flights with them. Check-in process was fine at Heathrow. After security, I went to the first class lounge on the south side of Heathrow terminal 5. The lounge had no air conditioning and so was very hot as it was a fairly warm day outside - this made it quite uncomfortable. The hot food selection was poor - everything was very liquid based and looked unappetizing. There were a few bland sandwiches available as well. While the lounge itself is in a beautiful, large room, it is really let down by the lack of good food and service. Boarding process was seamless at the gate. The plane had been recently renovated but the seats were highly uncomfortable. There is very little legroom available and if you're taller than 5'11\", you're knees will likely be touching the seat in front of you. Food offering was very limited with only a small bag of chips on offer and one drink. Flight attendants were courteous but didn't really go beyond the minimum. No inflight entertainment or wifi whatsoever was available, which is really a disappointment given that so many other airlines are now installing this. Overall, the trip was fine but the onboard and lounge experiences could be improved.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Upgraded on the outbound flight from London to Boston from Premium Economy to Business. Very pleasant experience but surprised to discover that my partner's entertainment system would not work. Mentioned the problem to a flight attendant who apologised when we landed and indicated that he had forgotten about it! Return flight was in Premium Economy which was fine except for breakfast. Every time I travel with BA I complain about the breakfast - sadly to no avail. No more sweet cereal bars please.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We booked the return from our honeymoon with British Airways from Naples to London Gatwick, and due to the occassion, we upgraded to club class and also paid extra to ensure that we were seated together. Two weeks before travel they decided to split our seats (without informing us). I found out when checking the Advanced passenger information that needed to be provided online. I obviously complained, explaining exactly what the trip was and how we had specifically paid extra to ensure we were seated together as recommended on their website. Their response was simply that they could not guarantee seats due to operational or safety reasons - but wouldn't tell me why they had chosen to change our seats two weeks before (only that it was an operational reason). The customer services representatives were unhelpful, refusing to look at moving any individual travellers, staff at the airport were rude and unhelpful. My wife is a nervous flyer as well, so the stress and anxiety actually really ruined our honeymoon with my wife being reduced to tears the day before we travelled. BA couldn't care less and wouldn't even give me an address to write to to complain. Awful customer service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow - Paris CDG return with British Airways. Bag drop at Terminal 5 quick and hassle free, checked in online so had my boarding pass on my phone. Security was busy at 13.00 but had an hour so no panic. First time I have used BA in 5 years without having access to the lounge through my frequent flyer status but the hour in the terminal pleasant. Boarding quick and seat 7A was spacious departed 20 minutes late with a 10 minute late arrival. Crew nice with a drink and snack provided on a 55 min flight. Return I had no checked baggage so straight through Terminal 2A which is a nice experience with shops and food outlets. Boarding at 17.45 for an 18.00 departure on to a half full A319, departed a little late which meant a late arrival in to T5. A nice flight, nice crew a drink and snack provided. Seat 24A with enough room. Pleasant trip for a short flight, I don't feel it's worth the extra cost for a business class seat, economy was fine. Will use again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Absolutely dire. They were installing a new check in system which failed. Huge queues at check in and we had to ask to be taken out of the line or we would have missed our flight despite arriving well in advance. They then lost our luggage, both mine and my partners, and they didn't even get it on the Glasgow flight. The luggage took 2 days to arrive in Zurich, that's 2 days from a 6 day break that we had to stay in waiting on luggage. Their online information service didnt match what we were told verbally on the phone and the people we spoke to were irritable, rude and unhelpful. We submitted a formal complaint on our return via BA website. It took them over 3 weeks to reply and when they did they accepted no responsibility and gave us a list of excuses about how they had a new check in service that was causing problems in London. Totally irrelevant to the problems in Glasgow. An appalling company and gone are the days where they had a good reputation for looking after customers. Unlikely we will ever fly with them again unless there is absolutely no other option.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "San Jose (Costa Rica) to Gatwick with British Airways. I was very unhappy with this flight. The seats were uncomfortable. The plane was old and the tv screens were scratched and appalling to watch. There were 2 drinks services the whole 10 hour flight, not including the 2 meals which were worse than usual. We couldn't get up and walk about as the seatbelt sign was on for extended periods. I didn't think there was much turbulence, I've had worse. The crew disappeared for extended periods of time. British Airways are obviously running on the cheap whilst trading on its previous good reputation. This is unacceptable. Compared to the Dreamliner which also has games, USB charging ports, new films and drinks on demand - this is vastly inferior and I will never travel BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point. Based on reviews here I had set my expectations of BA low and I was still disappointed.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Early morning flight to Amsterdam from London. A complicated schedule cause a little stir at check-in but check-in were woderful this morning and did their at most to assist. Straight to the plane which was an older B-767 with a 2-2-2 configuration in business class. Crew professional and efficient, choice between cold meet or full english for breakfast. Full served and cabin cleared in the 50 minutes the flight lasted. Despite a delay out of London we were down on time in Amsterdam. The cabin was crying out for a refurbishment but otherwise a good flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Newcastle to Las Vegas via London Heathrow. Heathrow to Las Vegas there were 3 groups of men who were extremely loud and unruly - it was particularly challenging for the attendants. In my opinion they handled a difficult situation professionally. They were totally run ragged. These passengers were a total disgrace but well done to the BA staff - they did really well.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "In April my husband and I had booked business class seats from Bermuda to London on British Airways. The flight was cancelled and we were rebooked on the next day in premium economy and to date, two months later, no refund or compensation. We are gold card members and fly to London business class about 12-14 times a year. The service from Customer Relations is absolutely unbelievable. Last September I had glass in my foot on a flight from Bermuda to London as a result of flight crew dropping drinking glasses and not cleaning up properly. No compensation. British Airways has the monopoly on flights from Bermuda to London and the service is simply terrible. What really bothers me is that no one cares from British Airways, and I have no idea of where to lodge a complaint.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Zurich - after reading all the negative reviews about British Airways, I was apprehensive as I had not flown on British Airways in over 10 years. I kept my expectations low. And I was not disappointed. Yes, the business class lounge at Terminal 5 was jammed with people. I did find a place at the far end to sit and charge up my phone. The large glass panes afford a panoramic view of the surrounding area and a section of the runways. A good variety of food and drinks but hard to move around given the crowds. The bathrooms could do with more frequent cleaning. As for the flight, it left and arrived on time. I was served a cold chicken salad (no choices) and a dessert and a selection of drinks were offered. The flight attendant servicing the business class section was solicitous. Pilot kept us informed of weather and flight direction. A large monitor in the cabin revealed and updated the flight route. For a relatively short flight, service was fine. True the seats were not larger, nor was leg space more but the middle seat had been covered by a tray and thus empty. Was able to board the plane first and disembark first and had my carry-on bags with me all the time. In sum, a matter-of-fact efficient trip that took me to my destination in good shape and on time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Booked flights with British Airways rather than a budget airline as thought they would be more reliable. We were returning from an overnight flight from the Dominican Republic and transfering to a domestic flight with BA. We arrived at BA's check in desk at 6am for our 9am flight, hoping to just drop our bags and relax until take off. When we arrived at check in we were advised the flight had been over booked and we would have to go on stand by. When we asked how can this be, we were advised by a manager that all airlines do this and check the small print. We stated as these flights had been bought and paid for over 6 months previous, so wanted to know how BA could re sell our seats, manager just kept repeating company policy. Manager stated we had to stay on stand by. As things turned out we did get stand by seats at the very last minute. I am appalled with the way this was handled and will not be using them again - buyer beware.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Miami with British Airways. Used my husbands miles plus money to book our flights to Miami. No kids packs given at all. Plane was very dated, entertainment system was shocking. Very small screens and all the films and programmes advertised on the website were not in my flight. Kids had just 3 films to choose from. 'Forgot' to load our previously selected kids meals so my kids went hungry, no apology offered - food was awful. Service was not good, not at all friendly. I found my flight with Virgin Atlantic the previous year far superior on their updated 747s. Overall very poor indeed would not chose to fly BA again. They have let their standards slip considerably.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to Lima with British Airways. This is a recently introduced non-stop route - offers a reasonable price for Club Class until you add the seat reservation charge which added a further £68 to each seat each way to the overall charge. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours at Gatwick while we waited for someone senior to sign off the repairs / fault. On the return journey the flight took off 1 hour late - no explanation and then when we arrived at Gatwick we stood for 1 hour for our luggage to appear while other flights around us arriving later collected theirs. There was little advantage if any to using BA on this route and we could have gone the existing routes through Madrid with little more hassle. The flight was comfortable, the staff pleasant and the food mediocre.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Going against the grain somewhat I have to say that I truly prefer flying with British Airways over Emirates on the London Heathrow - Dubai route. Having tried both airlines several times I am definitely going to side with BA on this one. Firstly, BA offer some really competitive prices on this route. If you happen to have a few Avios tucked away then this flight can be a real steal. Secondly, out of LHR, BA really does have the best terminal. Okay, so Terminal 3 for Emirates isn't the worst terminal in the world but I much prefer Terminal 5. Spacious, light and with good dining options. As for the aircraft, well it's a choice between choosing the passenger pleaser that is the A380 or the retro classic that is the B747. I'll happily fly in either, although even after the refit the 747 is still showing it's age. As an economy passenger I have found the product on British Airways to be perfectly reasonable. The seat pitch is average, seat comfort is average, IFE screen size again is average. You get a choice of the latest blockbusters and a few other options. With Emirates you have a huge IFE, thousands of films to choose from and slightly better seat width and pitch. However, I've also wondered what the appeal is of choosing from thousands of films that I have no interest in watching. I'd rather just take my iPad preloaded with films I actually want to watch. The lack of WiFi isn't a huge concern for me. Hopefully the GoGo 2KU product BA is installing from 2017 will be more robust. Now for the catering. As an economy passenger I'm not expecting much but on the last few flights with BA I have been pleasantly surprised. The food has not only been edible but also really quite tasty. Where BA falls down is on presentation which is quite frankly awful. It's also the little extras that I notice. A pre-dinner drinks service. Coffee and tea offered throughout the cabin. Real cheese and crackers to finish off the meal (As opposed to soft cheese - I'm not 5 years old). With BA you also get a more substantial snack prior to landing. It's just a little tuck box but it is far more generous than the Emirates economy offering. I've found the crew to be hit and miss, in fairness, I've found that treating crew in the same friendly and warm manner as you expect to be treated normally brings out the best in them. The recent newspaper deal with the Murdoch empire is a nice touch. Along with the Daily Hate and 'i' newspapers to choose from you also get The Times, The Sun and Financial Times as complimentary options. Arrivals for BA at DXB is a bit of a nightmare. Terminal 1 immigration is something else and the journey from runway to stand can be epic. However, the new concourse D for departures is really nice. Not too blingy. Overall, a pleasant flight. I would happily fly with BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Calgary return with British Airways, and we fly this route about twice a year, and in the past have flown in the 767s which were rather aged but homely! This time, we had the experience of the new Boeing 787 which was very nice and new, and we found the seats just as comfortable, particularily in Premium Economy. What we did not enjoy was the change in attitude from the staff, they seemed so different to the crews we had looking after us on the previous runs. The emphasis was on getting things served as fast as they can, and woe betide you if you want extra milk for your cup of coffee! The food was good, and we felt safe and efficiently cared for, but there was not the fun around that we used to encounter when wandering around in the small hours of the flight, when you could go to the galley and get a coffee or a snack. After all this is a long haul flight, and I can well understand the rush on a short haul flight. The person behind us was air sick, which was not their fault, and the cabin crew dealt with this well. Our return flight was better, and we enjoyed the glass of fizzy prior to take off, which is a nice touch, and is something that other airlines do in Premium Economy. I think that BA managers should travel with other airlines to review its premium economy brand. Finally, I think the breakfast is not very nice, and could be improved upon. Like another passenger, we went and had something after landing, those breakfast boxes are horrible!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Completely unimpressed with British Airways. They lost my luggage on a  flight from Dublin to London. When I informed them, they did not apologise but assured me I would have my bag by that afternoon. I was lucky my air BnB provided me with a towel and toiletries. I had not heard from them by 6pm and was told to wait until they contacted me. I then got a message at 8pm at night to say they had found my bag and the courier was picking it up at 10pm and then it would be delivered. So I specifically stayed home that night And finally decided at midnight they were not going to deliver it so went to sleep. I woke up and called British Airways at 9am to ask when it was going to arrive and where was it as I got a message saying it was being picked up at 10pm the night before so had stayed home. They said to call the courier company. I then called the courier company and they said that it was a mistake and they would never deliver a bag that Late at night. They then said the driver had a late night so wouldn't arrive until lunch time that day. so I went out for the morning and returned to my apartment at lunch. I then received a message at lunch time that said they would actually not arrive until sometime between 3 and 5pm that afternoon. I called to see if I could get a more specific time or they could tell me when they were on the way. They said no, and that I would have to wait at my apartment for two hours and to call at 6pm if my bag had not arrived. This was ridiculous. I am so lucky my air BnB hosts supplied me with towels and a toothbrush and that I had money to go out and buy clothes for the day. So unimpressed with British Airways and their disorganisation with my bag.  I understand bags are lost but to be told that it was coming at three different times and also the fact that British Airways decided it had nothing to do with them anymore and to contact the courier company was a joke. They were the ones who lost the bag in the first place on a 50 minute flight with no transfers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew to LHR T5 on British Airways with a connecting flight on Avianca to Bogota from Terminal 2. The staff at Paris airport refused to check-in my piece of luggage on the continuing Avianca flight because I had not booked that ticket with BA. I had bought 2 separate tickets. I realized that this would result in having to collect my luggage at T5, go through Passport control then go to Terminal 2 by Underground as there was a problem with Heathrow Express. When I pointed out to the BA staff the impact this would have they said it was my fault for booking 2 separate tickets, and Avianca are not part of oneworld like BA, but in Star Alliance.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Using an Avios redemption ticket we travelled out to Toronto in First Class with British Airways and the experience was superb. We checked in in London and the lady that checked us in was warm and friendly. The Concorde Lounge was good and we had a tasty table service breakfast before retiring to the sofa area to relax. The lounge is very comfortable and relaxing. Boarding was on time and we were met at the door and escorted to our seat. Immediately offered a glass of champagne and the service continued until landing. Lunch was very good, and served with style and attention to detail. The two cabin crew that took care of us were superb and the perfect combination of professional and chatty. Afternoon tea was perfect for this length and time of flight and we disembarked to find our bags first off the carousel in Toronto. All in all a great flight. The return flight was in Club World on the Upper deck of an ageing but lovable and well cared for 747, and was almost as good. The lounge in Toronto was small but comfortable and we dined before the flight where a good buffet was served with to order Pad Thai available. Upon boarding we were greeted by the most delightful crew members who personally introduced themselves and who clearly loved what they were doing. Individual and personal service was the order of the day and even though I did not eat, I was asked numerous times if I needed anything and felt very cared for. I often complain about BA baggage delivery but our bags were again first off the carousel and we were on the tube within 20 minutes after landing, and this even though immigration was busy. Could not fault this trip.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to New York JFK return. This was the first time for a while that I have been on a 747. Even although it was old it was in good condition and clean. Both flights were on time and no problems encountered . The seats were okay and the food was very good for economy. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. We were very pleased with the experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways has completely terrible customer service. I paid extra to fly BA instead of one of the cheaper airlines assuming some sort of quality of experience. The flight is more than 2 hours delayed with no reasoning and they refuse to book customers on another flight that has room on it and is departing earlier 'because it is closed' and willing to make the customer miss their connecting flight instead of finding a solution to a problem. People are extremely rude, don't provide any information to customers and don't provide any sort of solution to make the experience any better. Avoid this airline at all costs if possible unless you have a lot of free time and patience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways, and not overly happy with the experience. The A380 is an impressive jet, but despite paying the extra for Premium Economy the seats are like torture. It is impossible to get comfortable so sleep is not just elusive but impossible. Didn't feel that the Premium Economy experience was of any great value. Staff attentive and food reasonable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My first long haul flight with British Airways for some years and what a mistake! I flew Premium Economy expecting it to be on par with its competitors especially Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic - not so at all. At the airport, it took over 1 hour to check-in; there was no dedicated premium economy check in nor a premium economy boarding queue at the gate either; perhaps the plane would be a little special? No, not at all, it was an old Boeing 777 that had been designed to maximise seats at the expense of comfort; the cramped space of the premium economy cabin with its 2-4-2 seating was comparable to economy and was light years behind the modern and spaciousness of other airlines, and sitting in a middle row seat meant you could not physically squeeze past the person next to you to the aisle unless you woke the person up or you took your chance to stand over them and hope you manoeuvred successfully. Stupidly I had thought that competition would eliminate most differences between airlines. How wrong I was - avoid British Airways on the Hong Kong route if you are flying on a Boeing 777. My advise is to check the plane type before booking or you will suffer an expensive 13 hour flight reminiscent of over 20 years ago!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Traveled British Airways from Heathrow to Edinburgh return. Airport staff and cabin crew were polite and professional at both airports.

While waiting at the gate the captain approached the passengers, explained the reason for the delay and apologized, which was much appreciated. It was a good experience and I recommend BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore, and our first foray into British Airways Business Class (Club World) was not a success. Flat bed was made up of a hinged flap and it was over this flap that the inside passenger had to clamber. In my case he was a large passenger who had heavy shoes which had heavy heels. I am sure he tried to be careful, his leading heel edge hit my exposed ankle bone hard. The food was atrocious - the breakfast omelette was grey and inedible. As breakfast was served late it proved impossible to request a second cup of tea or coffee. The early morning hours snack was composed of doorstep sandwiches with little or no filling. The staff tried hard and I had water brought to me as I asked for it. But I had to find someone to replace used toilet rolls, paper towels and mop up the lavatory floor. Not expected in Business Class. Uncomfortable flight and never to be repeated by us.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Edinburgh to San Francisco via Heathrow on British Airways, A380 Premium Economy and the experience was very good. Short connecting flight from Edinburgh which due to being domestic you are treated as Business Class so get lounge access / priority boarding for domestic legs which was nice. A380 Premium Economy (seat 62k at the window) was excellent. Seat very comfortable, loads of space and great storage with bins at the side. Newspapers, warm towels and bubbles before takeoff. Inflight entertainment was good, food good and well presented. Food and drinks kept coming on the outbound flight. Return (night) flight a different experience. Same seats but staff were hardly seen due to a lot of people sleeping, but there were a lot of people asking for drinks / snacks etc and the service just seemed to lack a bit. No bubbles on the way back. Overall a great experience, very impressed with BA and the A380 Premium Economy highly recommended and well worth the extra.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Punta Cana with British Airways. Flight was announced as being 30 minutes late so we waited in the departure lounge. It said a gate would be announced but the given time came and went with no announcement. So it was soon evident that we would not be just 30 minutes late. Eventually, we boarded. It was a full flight so no space for spreading out. Crew were fairly efficient but not that friendly and one lady didn't seem to enjoy her job. She was in such a rush to get the dinner and drinks served so she could rest, she kept barking questions at passengers asking what they would like to drink etc. All unnecessarily stressful.  Seat very uncomfortable. IFE about 10 years out of date. I don't expect a route like Punta Cana is top of British Airways list for newer improved interiors or IFE. Food however was delicious. No gin is a big let down though. Seemingly no vodka either. Really?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight from London to Singapore on January 30th was perfect, a superb crew, helpful and chatty without being obtrusive. Cabin was comfortable, amenities, pyjamas etc of good quality. Food was rather dull, and not well prepared, perhaps 5-spice duck is not the best for an airline cabin. Wines and spirits were of good quality, and we arrived on time and in good shape. De-planing was efficient, and as expected in Singapore Changi, everything functioned well. The return flight  on March 3rd was not so good. The crew were sleepy and not particularly communicative; you had to ask for everything, even the meal schedule, and it took ages for dirty crockery to be cleared up. The flight arrived early, which was good, but as usual, Terminal 5 was still asleep, inefficient and ineffectual. We did not use the usual immigration channel, but it looked chaotic, as was the baggage re-claim nowadays.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Marrakech. The British Airways lounge at the airport has been closed for some time and therefore they are sharing the paid for No 1 lounge. It's overcrowded, me and my family couldn't get in to use it. The check in staff apologised about it, so they clearly know the problem. BA should inform the customer prior to booking that they are not able to provide the full service. British Airways customer services response was to inform me of their future plans, not very helpful. I would not recommend flying business class short haul out of Gatwick. Save your money and fly with someone else.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from London to Rio de Janeiro. Friendly cabin crew (ground staff a little sultry), clean modern cabin. Good announcements explained delay, and an attentive service for the flight. I pre booked our meal which means it comes far earlier than the wine and drinks, and without a few additions, such as cheese and crackers - but staff returned later with missing items. Not sure I'd pay for Premium Economy as really not a great deal of difference, other than space and food. Good selection of entertainment. Cabin crew present and attentive with juice and water for the flight. A good cup of tea and a kit kat available.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Miami to Manchester via London Heathrow with British Airways. The aircraft was very old and dated, and too hot with no airconditioning above the seat. Food was disgusting - some type of chicken mashed up with potato and peas. These 747 aircraft need to be updated or retired as they are now showing their age. Tv screens are so small and have no USB or power points. Outbound flight was with American Airlines that was so much better. New aircraft, good entertainment and food with was good. Now that you have to change terminals at LHR when connecting from Miami, there is no advange of flying BA. So if you can choose a different airline or if you have to fly BA, avoid the 747. The A320 on the domestic flight to Manchester was very comfy and looked so much better.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways in my mind is fast approaching a national tragedy. As one who has flown them on/off for 35 years I suggest I am qualified to have a view - having travelled in all cabins including Concorde. We flew Club Europe from London Heathrow to Pisa and back this last week over the Easter break. We have a home in Italy and fly the route often. Flight out started in the North Executive lounge at LHR. It was not busy and was OK. Terrible choice of unhealthy bacon baps and similar rolls stuffed with whatever. I had some fruit - tinned fruit. Plane was a newish plane and the so called \"new\" Club Europe. Three seats - with the middle one as a \"table\". Tables are usually in front of one - not to the side. Zero legroom unless you are in row \"1\". Last month I flew the regional Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. Needless to say - British Airways does not come close when it comes to seat comfort. Disgraceful. Food okay on both flights. FAs on both flights were also fine. The curtain separating the Club cabin from Economy was broken, hence we had queues for the WC stretching into the Club cabin.Its long overdue - but BA need some serious management changes to build value into their key products.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "St Lucia to London Gatwick in Premium Economy on 30th March, and I had the worst flight I have had for some time on British Airways. No newspaper, inedible curry chicken, no wine, no coffee. Breakfast again was inedible and no coffee. Inflight entertainment awful with old films on very small screen. Oxygen levels very low with many passengers complaining of headaches etc. Staff not interested yet as usual British Airways employees sneak into business class and seemed to get a reasonable service! As usual, you say never use them again on this route but very little choice as only competition is Virgin and they are not that good either. Compared to airlines like Emirates, Qantas, Air New Zealand etc, BA have much to learn. Have used Thomsons to Barbados and Mauritius in Premium Club section on the Boeing 787 and it was a fantastic experience. Great food, service comfy seats and super in flight entertainment.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Abu Dhabi to Heathrow. Seating narrow and uncomfortable but seems to be the norm with this aircraft with most airlines. Cabin crew excellent, but when they move friends or British Airways employees from Economy to Premium Economy or Business Class after boarding is complete they should do so discreetly without fare paying passengers noticing. The food served has declined in quality and quantity. The English breakfast used to be one of the best meals in Economy on BA. Now there is no bacon in it but rubbery mushrooms and the scrambled egg equally rubbery. Truly awful meal. Flight on time and entertainment system getting better. At least the screens on this newer aircraft are bigger than those on the ancient 747's still operated by British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Chicago to London Heathrow, and terrific in-flight service and food. The updated in-flight entertainment service is great with a very large selection of films and TV shows.

Efficient boarding and disembarkation with luggage first off the belt at both airports.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Athens on BA642 (2/4/16) and returned on BA643 (9/4/16). We decided to take a break from the low cost airlines and fly British Airways to Athens as we had found very cheap flights (£50 per person per way) and good flying times. As someone travelling with us is registered blind we could reserve seats before others on both flights with ease, priority boarding was given as well. Online check in was smooth and boarding passes on the outbound were printed off. On our flight out to Athens we were given a choice of a hot or cold meal. As I had something to eat before; I passed, but this was great given that some people would have been transiting quickly and wouldn't have time to eat at the terminal. The night flight on the way back was also good as meals (one hot option only) were offered with free drinks and pillows were available. Flight attendants were professional on both flights. Both flights landed early (one 35mins early!). If there is anything I could ask BA to improve on is allowing one desk open at Athens for all flights of the day for anyone that arrives early and just wants to print off boarding passes or offer self service kiosks at other airports outside of London. In conclusion British Airways are better than easyjet or Ryanair and if there is only a little price difference I would recommend travelling with them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew London Heathrow to Houston IAH. Avios ticket, and British Airways gold card holder. Having taken my food order before others on the outbound sector, I was a bit surprised to find they had given \"my\" risotto to another passenger. They were very apologetic however and allowed me to choose something from the First menu. Aside from that, the journeys were uneventful, and the quality of food was better than the last few times. Overall I'm quite happy with this latest BA experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Manchester to Los Angeles via Heathrow with British Airways. Pre paid for emergency exit seats for our flight and was allocated these at check in. 45 minutes later when trying to board flight, we were stopped and told we were now at the back of the plane with our tickets given to BA staff, who were sitting comfortably. It transpires we have to contact BA ourselves to get our money back after filling in a form. This sums up British Airways now, as an airline where customers are effectively charged for something they aren't provided with and then BA making it so difficult that they hope they get to keep the money, customer service is non existent. Other than this, all 4 flights we took were late, our son was given child meals we hadn't booked, the choice of meals was one of only two options both were disgusting, one of the seats was broke on a new A380 and the seats were incredibly uncomfortable in that you could feel the metal frame as there is no padding in the seats. An internal Virgin America flight we took had more space and more comfortable seating than BA's A380. I cannot find anything positive to say about them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Pisa to Chicago via London Heathrow. This route is one that I have done many times. Bought my ticket using British Airways miles and their part of the trip did not disappoint. The flight from Pisa to London Heathrow on an A320, was flawless. The check-in was normal, flight was fine, there were IFE and food and beverages served. I proceeded to my next flight, which was operated by American Airlines. Boarding was on time, which is the only positive thing about this flight. The seats are old, IFE had no selection of movies, when I searched for action and adventure there was only one film! How was I supposed to stay entertained on an 8 hour plus flight if there aren't any movies? The food was awful, and the best thing I can say is they gave lots of drinks. The food didn't sit well on the stomach, and trying to drink an alcoholic beverage just made it worse. I ordered a vegetarian meal, and was served a very bland and flavorless pasta. When breakfast was served I was given the same dish. The crew was careless and seemingly did not want to hear about my problems. There was no way to sit comfortably and I dreaded the flight since the moment my foot stepped aboard the plane. Arrived ahead of schedule, another positive thing. Once I cleared security I found that there is a British Airways flight, actually operated by British Airways, that arrives at the same time. Next time I fly this route with them I will make sure to not get an American Airlines leg, especially long haul. Truly unpleasant experience for the most of my journey.: 1 occurrences\n",

Because of a 2 hours and 35 minutes delay in Montreal, they made me miss my connection in London. They booked me on another flight which made me wait a further 4 hours in London instead of 2 hours. Now, back to Montreal from Marseille, my flight is delayed, one more time. I am not what you would call a happy customer.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Larnaca. I find travelling with British Airways somewhat hit and miss at times. Having flown extensively over the past few years in both club and economy with them it seems a gamble on how the flight attendants moods are. On our flight to Larnaca the FA's had a terrific attitude , were courteous and the cabin service director was professional and polite. The older type seating is far more comfortable than the new slimline seating adopted but still only just bearable after nearly 5 hrs of sitting. The 767,s still have an air of spaciousness compared to the A320 that is used on this route. All in all a good flight but compared to some airlines that offer a lie flat seat with personal entertainment systems on medium haul routes BA is falling behind.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Rotterdam, returning Amsterdam to London. City Airport is undergoing renovation work, which gives the pier to the gates the feel of an abandoned warehouse. The gate lounge is a little more than a Portakabin. This trip felt a bit like catching a bus, which is fine for business travel I guess. Onboard the outbound flight was less than half full. BA's Embraer fleet are pretty new and clean. The E-170 is a fun little plane to travel in, with steep ascents out of LCY and some tight turns. Cabin crew excellent and a small snack (shortbread, popcorn or crisps) and drink were served on this 40-minute flight. Immigration and baggage reclaim at RTM is a breeze. On the return leg, onboard service was excellent. As it was an evening flight the free bar service was much appreciated. Arrivals at LCY was a shambles, the flooded toilets being particularly unpleasant. Shame they don't fly to Rotterdam from Heathrow though - T5 is far more pleasant than LCY.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Toronto to London sleeper service means you can have a buffet dinner in the lounge rather than onboard the plane to maximise rest time.

The negative issue is that British Airways business class seat selection costs extra if done in advance.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Tel Aviv to London Heathrow with British Airways. Fast and efficient check in. Plane left on time and crew was very nice and did not give the impression of being rushed. Seat comfort was Club World format which is a nice surprise. Food selection and quality top notch. Absolutely no complaints.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways have randomly cancelled a flight two weeks before departure from Athens to London that now means I miss a wedding that I booked 3 months ago. I, as a gold card holder, have a connecting flight to Buenos Aires on BA. Regardless they put me on a flight that would have missed this connection. Subsequently they have put me on a flight that now actually is impossible to connect from the island I am on. Now they have said that to rebook I need to repay - thanks BA for looking after your gold card holder so well - I highly recommend book with anyone but BA for shortfall - better with Easyjet, Ryanair, cheaper and better. If they treat Gold Card holders that have 5 confirmed business bookings this way - good luck to economy travellers. I am embarrassed to be called a gold card member. You cancel flights for commercial reasons two weeks before and do not care the consequences for any long term clients.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever. The entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. A few decent movies but not much else. I thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I flew to Dublin from London Heathrow in Business Class on a Avios upgrade with British Airways. We used the lounge in terminal 5 which had a good selection of food and drinks. We were delayed leaving for just over an hour for technical reasons. Salmon salad and a couple of drinks on the hour flight. Good value with an almost free upgrade, would not pay the normal price for such a short trip.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Second time in 10 days on this flight from London Heathrow to Basel. What has happened to the leg room on British Airways? At 1m 80 my knees were against the seat in front. There used to be a good 3/4 inches of leg room. The \"food\" which BA proudly advertise consists of a very small sandwich. As usual the onboard staff are the saving grace. Going downhill BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways business class from London Heathrow to Santorini. The seats are a joke and in reality are economy seats sold as a business class package. No leg room and BA attempt to improve the experience by blocking the middle seat for a 2x2 configuration (A/C and D/E). The problem is they use an upended tray which is bolted into the seat and cannot be moved. At least If the middle seat was vacant couples could stretch across and free up some much needed space. Our flight was delayed by a hour traveling out and so we were stuck in our seats for almost five hours. Flight was full in business (9 rows taken up) and quickly became stuffy. Since this is an economy seat at a business price it is almost impossible to work out BAs business strategy. Will not fly on this leg again with BA and will take my custom to an alternate airline.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Johannesburg, and I decided this time to fly with British Airways given they fly there with the A380. I was quite looking forward to the experience of flying Business Class on the upper deck of the A380. I needn't have bothered. Following an uneventful few hours in the Galleries Lounge it was time to board, straight onto the upper-deck. My business colleagues before me passed through the gate without problem, however I was told to wait a moment as there was an issue with my boarding card - \"just a moment sir, oh it looks like you've been approved for an upgrade to First which is on the lower deck - no, sorry, my mistake - you're still in Business upstairs but I'm afraid we've had to move you from your selected seat\" (the one I'd paid the not inconsiderable sum of £80 to reserve in advance by the way) - but not to worry, it's still a window seat\". Except it wasn't - it was seat 50A, a windowless seat next to the toilets. The journey itself was uneventful. The food a bit of a disappointment without any flavour, my beef main was dry and rather tasteless. The wine was very good. Entertainment system not bad, though not a patch on the likes of Emirates. The staff friendly and efficient enough and I managed to sleep a few hours. I wrote to BA to complain about my change of seat and the unprofessionalism of telling someone they had an upgrade when they hadn’t. I had to chase up twice for a reply. The one I eventually got was pitiful and as impersonal as could be with a stock answer about the need for them to occasionally change people’s seats for operational needs The biggest issue for me with BA’s Club World however is its ridiculous layout whereby people have to step over each other’s legs - I don’t know of any other business class product which has this and it leaves BA well behind the competition. Although not my favourite airline, BA could do worse than take a note of their partners Iberia which has a staggered layout but offers direct aisle access to all. The situation whereby you find yourself starring at strangers until one of you decides to raise the privacy screen is also far from ideal and surely not safe as the cabin crew have to constantly lower it to pass hot food and drinks over your neighbour. Can’t help but think that BA have missed a real opportunity to shake things up with their new fleet of A380s. Whilst some airlines have been creative and had on-board bars, lounges and showers, BA has just packed in as many seats as possible – there are 7 abreast in Club World upstairs and 8 Downstairs which is staggering and an insult when paying premium prices. I should have known better having flown on one of BA’s other new additions to its fleet last year, a Boeing 787 to Toronto, which also was extremely claustrophobic. I returned home from South Africa upstairs on a Boeing 747 from Cape Town to London. The plane might have been older but the experience altogether more pleasant. This journey ironically took me up to Silver Membership, I won't be choosing to fly long-haul with BA again however, unless I have to. There are far better alternatives out there.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "These days I dread flying British Airways either long haul or short haul. This flight in business class from London Heathrow to Nice was a pleasant surprise, the galleries lounge at T5 is usually rammed and dirty but as our flight was 8 am it wasn't too bad although as usual the food offerings very poor compared to other airlines. Boarding a mess, surely if you have paid to fly business class you should be able to board before gold, silver members who then wander down to economy. Great FAs, nice hot or cold breakfast choice and 2 drinks offerings on the 1hr 30 min flight, luggage off promptly. Return again good, stacked over Kent for 15 mins, luggage took 30 minutes to get to belt, priority bags all over the place. Would use again for a short hop but try and avoid business long haul.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to Amsterdam. I was bumped off this British Airways flight as a result of a change of plane, to an A319 I gather. The process was not well handled, and it appeared that some staff and/or standby passengers were given priority, although others also missed out I understand. The main issues were lack of clarity at the airport as to what the issue was, last-minute confirmation of offloading (which left us short of time to take another flight), a poor process for transferring airports (I had to bus from Gatwick to Heathrow), and poor follow-up when I queried matters afterwards. BA refused to state whether staff or standby passengers had been prioritised, repeatedly citing privacy. I checked with a friend who's a UK privacy legal specialist, and this applies to individuals but not to categories such as staff or standby, so it appears to be a refusal by BA to respond. I also raised the transfer with BA, as this involved further queueing to turn a voucher into a ticket, which meant I missed a transfer bus. Better to issue a ticket, or a voucher that can be used on any service that day, with BA to arrange it so with the bus company. On the positive side, I was compensated per the rules, and did make a BA flight later that day, which was OK. Nonetheless, this could have been handled much more smoothly, and I'm afraid British Airways customer service on the ground and in follow-up let them down.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Toronto to London in British Airways club world on avios and companion voucher. Prompt check in at Pearson with friendly staff. The club lounge is well run with dinner served as this is a sleeper service. A good choice of food though though the wine list remains unimaginative. The lounge is too small when busy. Additional toilets are needed - too few with queues before the flight was called. Friendly staff on the flight with lights out after takeoff and a tray service offered. The dessert and cheese and drinks was perfect before an ok sleep. The flight is too short for a decent sleep and the club world layout is now dated and in a real need of a re-think. Once cutting edge, it's not fun being stepped over by a stranger and there is a real lack of privacy. Breakfast was ok with the hot muffin being a confused offereing. Returning from Heathrow 10 days later started with a very slow check in process - unusual for T5 with agents blaming cancellations from the previous day spilling over. Went straight to the club lounge on the B gates which is a hidden gem - quiet, well stocked, few children and in good condition. Pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to first on arrival in the lounge . A superb flight with BA first at it's best. Decent vintage champagne before take off, friendly, engaging and professional crew made the experience really first class - impressive given the cabin was full. Great Rose Champagne, an excellent wine list - especially the reds, and well cooked food. A movie, afternoon tea and we arrived head of time into Toronto. The bags almost beat us off. BA can be variable in service - especially in Club World and some of the cost cutting in recent years - though these return flights reminded me of the old BA and how good it can be at its best.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Miami return with British Airways. Delay outbound and back with poor communication of both. Told of a delay which was extended once we reached the gate and on the return journey and then again once on the plane. Service on the return journey seemed like stewards were \"going through the motions\" rather than worried about the level of service. I does seem that the British Airways flights to Miami and back to London Heathrow have very poor punctuality when alternative airlines don't have the same issue. Inflight entertainment on inbound flight not fully working after a reeboot which was done because some passengers had no service for the first hour.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Ibiza return. booked pretty late and just a one night business trip. Checked in on line and used bag drop at LGW North Terminal which was quick, as was the fast track security. Not a normal user of Gatwick, using LHR every month but found LGW had improved a lot since my last visit 5 years ago. The lounge used by BA is the No1 Travellers lounge which was ok - pretty full and service a little slow. Boarding onto an ex BMI A319 via a bus but pretty well organised, seat 3F the old Club Europe layout. Food and crew okay on this 2hr 35min flight arrived just about on time. Return no online check in available so checked in at the airport by a rude Iberia agent, no lounge either at Ibiza but not a problem. Late departure of around 1 hr boarded by bus onto A320 with new seat layout, seat 1A which was nice. Crew friendly, service and food on this flight were better than I've had on BA for a while - arrived about 30 min late on to a bridge, bags off very quick so no complaints. I would use LGW again, BA I use most months.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A big improvement over the same leg 15 months earlier. British Airways in Economy from Heathrow to Miami outbound, business class Chicago to Heathrow inbound. Lounge service in Chicago excellent for me (Mum) and acceptable for my daughter - this time there was at least some simple-ish food which was child-friendly. Staff were friendly to the children on both legs, took time to fill out her flyer logbook.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways generally does a good job in economy, with reasonably friendly and efficient service. The onboard food and drinks are a shadow of what they used to be but fares in real terms are much lower these days and this is an acceptable trade-off. This particular flight from Dubai to London was packed and I certainly wasn't comfortable sitting next to a large guy, squished into one side of my seat. But the cabin crew were fine and one attendant was charming. It's only when I pay to fly business or first that I get irritated. I'd put British Airways ahead of many rivals in economy and behind in premium classes, where the food is particularly disappointing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London Heathrow - Sao Paulo-Guarulhos on the 14/04 on the upper deck and it was probably my best flight. The FAs were brilliant and the service outstanding.

      "Doha to London via Bahrain with British Airways, and a very poor lounge in Doha. Even flying First Class on BA there is no reciprocal arrangement to access the excellent Qatar Airways Lounge. Instead there is a lounge for all other airlines. On boarding my wife and I were ushered to our seats. And to our amazement our individual lockers were opened by the flight attendants who promptly disappeared without making an offer to hang our coats or jackets, as is standard practice on even business class. No hot towels before take off or landing, very average menu, and as we slept through dinner were keen on breakfast. Told that due to possible turbulence coffee could not be prepared, both our cutlery earlier wrapped by the crew were delivered without spoons to eat the very soggy muesli. Orange juice tropics a quality. We had to ask for marmalade with our toast. All the crew displayed little perception of customer needs, made the more marked by Qatar Airways Business class crew who were absolutely excellent on the earlier Sydney to Doha Flight. Poor food, very poor crew awareness, or attention to detail, who seemed to be going through the motions. Slightly aloof. Way below the 3 Gulf majors in flight attention. However bed was very good, as you would expect. Amenity kit below the Qatar Airways Business class kit, and a joke in comparison to Qatars First class kit. Very agreeable cabin and seats, but crew performance at economy class performance. Would avoid again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Bergen. Took off and landed on time. Sandwich on the outbound flight was good with plenty of drinks on this short flight.

I only booked a week before flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Toronto to Lisbon connecting in London (outward) and stopover in London (return) with British Airways. A mix of Premium Economy and Economy. Easy check in at Toronto where the staff are great and the club lounge as usual was clean, welcoming and well run. OK boarding with juice and water offered on boarding. Bizarrely, no sparkling wine offered (\"Sir - we only offer sparkling wine on flights from London\") No hot towel after take off but menu card offered. One round of drinks followed by dinner. Steak was overcooked, dry and with a greasy gravy - the worst meal to date. The biggest insult was the breakfast which has been downgraded from the \"muffin or nothing\" to a basket of smaller muffins, chocolate and cereal bars plus tea / coffee and juice. Just when you thought BA couldn't stoop any lower, they manage to find something else to nickel and dime. Good club lounge in T3 with decent showers. The flight from London to Lisbon was one of the best short haul flights for me. A younger mixed fleet crew were really friendly, offered great service and a prompt drink and snack service - a tasty roll (2 bites) and a desert (1 bite) with second drinks provided on request. Returning from Lisbon, a dreadful bus transfer to the aircraft, a more sullen and older crew with average service with the mini savory roll replaced by sweet or savory snacks (shameful that BA are increasing the sugar on offer across most flights with the current diabetes debate). The BA lounge on the B gates at T5 remains my favourite lounge with plenty of space and some peace and quiet. Onboard one of the old 747's with the old configuration with PE in front of biz class with juice, water or sparkling wine offered on boarding. My IFE had frozen before I sat down and even after reset had a mind of it's own. The safety video was abandoned soon after starting for a manual demo as there were clearly IFE issues across this aging 747. I finally gave up watching TV as the channel kept changing. No hot towels again. One drinks round and on asking for the little bag of pretzels, I was told they had be cut by embarrassed crew (at around 10p a bag - really?) A vile coleslaw starter, a choice of steak or butter chicken curry which I had and a small pot of chocolate pudding completed dinner. The chicken was tasty but not a business class entree (as claimed) by any stretch of the imagination. Tea and coffee but no after dinner drinks (had already been cut). The biggest insult in this continuing degradation of service is the scrapping of the second meal. The sandwich has gone with either 1 cookie or single finger of chocolate with tea / coffee with clearly embarrassed crew (again). This constant reduction in the PE product with the small stuff can't go much lower - there's only the seats and space left! Ironically, whilst in Lisbon the announcement was made regarding short haul food and drink being charged for in economy. BA are being disingenuous to suggest that people are asking for improved catering - yes, they're asking because you've cut the service back so much in the first place. I'd pay for a decent M&S sandwich but I enjoy my free drink. Charging for tea / coffee and juice - even Air Canada haven't stooped that low. I really worry for BA's future. The drive to improve the bottom line has gone too far. I don't see fares being reduced to reflect the reduced service. The board of BA / IAG group and their shareholders should be ashamed and embarrassed with themselves as the demise of the UK's flag carrier continues.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was the first time in a decade that I have flown British Airways economy across the Atlantic from London to Chicago. It wasn't as unpleasant as I had expected and I wouldn't mind doing it again. I was surprised by how minimalist the catering has become, including breakfast being reduced to a roll. Having said that, I'd be happy to buy some food at the airport, if only BA would allow passengers to buy a decent bottle of wine on board. It's when you pay for premium that the food becomes annoyingly bad.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A good flight from Heathrow to Stockholm. Busy and chaotic boarding as didn't board by row number. Therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage, flight was then late. On board meal now a bag of crisps or biscuits but I know that by January even that will have gone, thereby relegating BA to a low cost airline. Not surprised mind you, as they have to compete with the others, but BA will need to keep their prices keen. Female crew were as friendly as ever. Males less so.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check-in at Singapore Airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was done quickly, efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal. Boarding was chaotic. After announcing families with children, first and club passengers, and cardholders, the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance. As before, the cabin crew were professional, helpful and enthusiastic. Dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight. It seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs, British Airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small. Nevertheless, the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits. After a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and I slept soundly for several hours. The seat is equipped with two USB ports but these put out such little power by iPhone took a long time to charge and they could not handle an iPad. We landed at Heathrow on time and reached Terminal 5 within a matter of minutes. One of British Airways’ greatest assets is its cabin crew who, in my experience, are considerably better than their rivals. What the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save money and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines. It might have been a one-off but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Beijing to London Heathrow. The cabin crew did their best, but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers. Cut backs are evident everywhere, from the small and very cheap hot towels (offered only once during the ten hours flight) and the nuts (presented in a packet, other than with other airlines on china and warm - this might seem a small niggle, but it is indication of BA saves costs - by annoying their premium cabin customer). The amenity kits, presented in a shoe bag, is a joke really. To be honest one gets a better premium cabin product from other One World members (Royal Jordanian and Qatar for example). Flight left and arrived on time - but the airline should be more than that. The offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground. Was presented, at the second meal serice, with frozen pawns on bread (returned and a de-frosted plate came by return). Unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea - but no effect as yet. Part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight, I covered it up with a spare blanket. Despite there being enough toilets for Club World passengers there was often a line of people waiting from World Traveller Plus - snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16. No control of passengers from World Traveller Plus coming in to the Club World cabin. Toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew - twice they were in a bit of state so I ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself. Lovely. Shame to see one of the great carriers fall to such low levels.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Amsterdam to London. As a member of their Executive Club and someone who has flown with British Airways 3 times this year I now regard them as the airline of last resort. The service on BA is beneath contempt. Ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying, but in my experience Ryanair service and punctuality beats BA with their reliance on a long lost reputation. Every BA flight I have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption. From disruption in the cabin the like of which I have never witnessed on any airline other than British Airways, to delays on nearly all BA flights I have taken in 2016, rude, surly staff that act like BA was still a 1970's state enterprise. Now when I search a flight and BA appears I shudder. It is even worth leaving the UK so you get a different national airline. There were even problems with the booking process. What makes matters worse is that British Airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. After experiencing the modern T5, we boarded our flight on time and got sat down. We were in an older 777-200, so the seats weren't very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small. We departed late as they had to unload bags, they also had to reset the entertainment system. In the air we were offered beverages. Later in the flight, the meal service. There was chicken curry (I had it - it was nice but the rice was a bit dry) and a pink-looking coleslaw as a side salad. The dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse, which was good. The other alternative was a pasta. I watched some films - there was a good range - and I like how the BBC News is up to date so I could catch up with the current affairs. The crew were not overly friendly, but kept servicing us with extra drinks. I had a nap, and then we were served a small landing snack. The much rumoured Mars Bar is actually true, as well as some Belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks. We landed on time, but had to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow / Pisa return. My wife and I fly this route 3-4 times a year as we have a home in Tuscany. Sometimes we pay in long advance to get a decent price, or we pay using Avios. This return trip was the latter. It is what it is. The most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world. I have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return. BA should be ashamed of themselves. The only reason we fly this product is that you get the business class lounges in both directions. The seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit. The new meals are quite good and the free (is it really free?) booze. The seats are the biggest con. Three seats for two - with a dumb table in the middle. Unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster. On the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine. On the way back - a ploughman's lunch, it was okay-ish. As a 60 year old businessman, one who has worked globally in my career in the US, Japan and the Middle East - and having sold my business a few years ago, to one of the largest PLCs in the country - I think I know a bit about running companies. I know I could do a lot better than the current board at BA. Last week when I was away, I read that BA have posted well in excess of one billion profits last year. Oh, what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors. So what would I do with Club Europe? I'd make it the best in Europe. The seat would be larger, like an arm chair. A 2+2 configuration. There would be a nice centre table. Charge ports for phones/laptops. Headsets. TV screens mainly for news - but some movies for flights over 2 hours. Extra 6\" of leg room behind row \"1\". Nice cutlery and glass/china ware. Hot meals. And i'd probably sell it at £25 a flight more. \"Build value guys\" and the profits will follow. Its the oldest dictum in the book. I will give credit where credit is due. On the way back, on the ground, the Captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron. As an aviation buff I loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal. Clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane. He picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk, the length of plane, asking if anyone had concerns or questions. One or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure. Very nice chap. We took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine. FAs in both directions were very good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA34 KUL-LHR 6 Sept, return BA11 LHR-SIN-KUL on 16 Sept. All flights in World Traveller Plus with the exception of SIN-KUL on MH economy. On the KUL-LHR leg, the aircraft was clean and spacious in the PY cabin. The seats were the biggest let down. Whilst there was adequate legroom, they were hard and uncomfortable, especially when reclined with virtually no lumbar support. The headrest did not move at all. The seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide, there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which I think is a missed opportunity by BA to maximise utilisation of space. The food was okay, you get two meals, the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke. IFE was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging. The return flight was on an A380. Excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight. Again, seats were the same but the A380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin. Staff were less conspicuous this time around. Overall, I would recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "What a shame to once upon a time being such a good airline, to now budget service at a high price! Was such an old tatty plane each way, very uncomfortable. Entertainment was old and tired. Had to keep pressing many times just to change the channel. Food was like mush on the way there and on the return they served me a vegetarian meal as that's all they had left. The cabin crew service was very poor on the return flight. The crew looked miserable as if they didn't enjoy their job. Asking for anything was like a chore for them. One of the crew looked so untidy, her hair was all over the place. I asked to buy a bottle of perfume, when they came round with the duty free. The steward said he would come down with it soon. I waited and waited, then approached him an hour before landing. He apologised and said he forgot, that he will bring it down now. Again I waited, and just before we were ready to land I asked again, he returned with a bashed in box of perfume and said sorry but this is the last one. I couldn't except it as it was very badly presented for a gift. After all that if I knew it was the last one, then I would have chose something else, but it was too late as we were landing. Terrible 12 hour flight.: 1 occurrences\n",

Disappointed with lack of snack with bar service, in fact I previously flew in June and the airline always provided a fully stocked 'help yourself' tuck box. Inflight meals a disappointment compared with other airlines. Inflight entertainment satisfactory. I have had better inflight experiences with other non direct airlines on this route.: 1 occurrences\n",

Business seat same as economy everyone now knows about, but the downgraded food - lunch consisted of a small plate with a slice of ham, slice of Palma ham and dollop of buffalo mozzarella cheese and a bread roll. And that was that. Not even butter with the roll. Guess the value of food was about GBP1. Crew did their best with a poor product. Flight on time.

Gate shown about an hour before departure. Waited for 30-45 mins at gate as plane was delayed by about 20 minutes. Boarding took a very long time as it was a full flight. Once on board the aircraft we departed quickly.The seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough. Once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service, but no pretzels like BA used to do. About 2 hours after take off food was served. (chicken curry or vegetable lasagna). Lunch was quite nice, but small. After lunch duty free was sold. Four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off. The IFE was OK, there were lots of movies and tv shows, but not many games. Also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on. Screen was small but touch screen still worked. Between meals there were snacks available, but they had to be paid for (there used to be a free snack box). Drinks were also avaliable and free between meals. An hour before a sandwich, kitkat and a drink were served, the size was not adequate, but tasted nice. After the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into Tampa airport. Once we landed it was a long walk to immigration, however the queue was short. Overall the flight was not bad. Not much food, but crew were helpful and attentive.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Appalling food, especially on the Orlando-Gatwick return leg. Choice of a horrible-smelling curry and a vegetarian pasta, the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory. There was a roll but no butter, instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered. For 'breakfast' we were given a tough bagel with a filling of cream cheese that was probably only a few molecules thick. No juice etc. The attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when I asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served. The amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of would have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable. The flight attendant suggested that I should recline my seat as well and couldn't understand when I refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite. Eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat back off her own bat. I felt very sad that my national airline of British Airways has lowered itself to these standards of food and customer service. The seat was OK but nothing to write home about.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "It does seem that many of the negative reviews of British Airways come from passengers travelling First or Business class. My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Los Angeles and found the entire experience extremely good. Boarding was efficient, the seats were comfortable and the leg room more than adequate. IFE was very good. The food was, well, it was airline food and you cannot expect haute cuisine at 38,000 ft. It was tasty enough, and there was some decent red wine. The cabin crew were excellent in every way, both friendly and efficient. Would I recommend BA to a friend? Yes, without question.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Our flight from London to Boston was okay. Disappointed to only be able to sit in middle of row of 10. Annoying to have to pay extra to have a window seat. Also catering on board is disappointing with only one meal plus a biscuit but crew were friendly and helpful. The return flight was different. Staff not particularly helpful. Person in front reclined seat fully and I wasn't able to fit food tray in. Crew member said I was causing problems for the man in front when I requested he put his seat up to eat. Also armrests did not lift up leaving less than 6 inches between seat in front and armrest meaning I was literally trapped in my seat for 6 hours. Not comfortable and unsafe in an emergency. We had one drinks trolley followed by a meal around an hour later. Staff then disappeared and only water or juice available for rest of flight. Will not use BA again. Delta and Virgin flights offer much better service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to Valencia with British Airways. Boarding the flight at Gatwick was good, professional and orderly. Ground staff at the airport were lovely and check in was efficent. Onboard we got out of the gate and under way quickly. Seats were fine, plenty of leg room back in economy, although they seemed to be a little dirty when I sat down but I thought nothing more of it. During the flight the cabin crew were professional doing their duties. All friendly and welcoming. Food wise we only got complementary biscuits - a little bit of a let down - but on a short flight like this totally understandable. Drinks were fine, got the normal selection: Coke, coffee, juices etc. On the return flight it was slightly different. They seemed to have less in stock not only in the food department but also the inflight shop. Disappointed in this as what I wanted to buy wasnt avaliable.But on this return flight the positives outweigh the negatives. Flight crew again amazing. All kind and welcoming like the first flight. Overall the flights were nice. Well worth the money. Definitely would fly with them again on short haul flights through europe.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Seville via Madrid. If you want budget airline service but decent airline prices, look no further than British Airways. I used to fly a lot with BA for both business and pleasure. But lately they really started dropping the ball. In 2016 I had a streak of 8 consecutive flights all delayed by 30 min to more than 2 hours. But that is not the worst. Recently I booked a flight to Seville from London. After a few weeks this flight got cancelled. It took me 3 different operators to find a solution via Madrid on the same day. ('No I don't want to fly the next day!). But guess what, 1 month later my outbound to Madrid got cancelled as well. Again it took some time to find an alternative. Ultimately I had to settle for a 7 hour travel time instead of 2.5 hours. Also I need to take extra holiday and additional costs to get to my destination in Seville. After complaining to BA about this process, I expected to get some sort of compensation, after all I'm an esteemed Silver member (their words). But none of that. A few phone calls later I am stuck with an automated e-mail service replying to me that no compensation is possible. I didn't ask for any money or anything. All I asked for is to waive the re-booking fee if I ever have to change a flight. This seemed only fair after BA cancels flights willy-nilly and doesn't take the customer into account. If this is the service extended to a Silver member, then I really don't want to know what they do to customers not part of their frequent flyer scheme.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways state that you can check in for free. When I checked availability 24 hours prior to the flight, there were only three seats available for the three of us. I also like to have a window seat however only available seats were aisle seats in C or J. Due to online check in, I had only the option to select an aisle seat. At T5 at LHR I spoke to BA customer services who advised that depending on how much you pay for the seat, only certain seats will appear available - in short, the less you pay, you get only the less popular seats with some not being available. This is apparently a new policy and the staff member said it has led to many complaints from customers. The aircraft was a 747-400 reg G-CIVV built in 1998. The aircraft had been renovated a couple of years ago and had new seats and LED lighting. However the aircraft tables were not clean, leg room was poor and the 747 is \"an embarrassment\". These are the words of a cabin crew member, not me. True - the 747 is an embarrassment when compared to the new airliners. Cabin crew were very friendly however were not widely seen, only towards the start of the flight. Food was ok - veg lasagne and a nice choc mousse. However only one meal followed towards the end of the flight by a fun size chocolate bar and undrinkable coffee. BA wake up - look to see what the competition is doing aircraft wise and sort out your unfair check in policy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Bucharest with British Airways. To fly to disappoint. After my arrival in Heathrow T5 the check-in area for Club Europe was clearly marked and separated for the rest of the check-in lounge and a host was guiding you to the check-in line. After saying hello to the host making my way to the check-in line I was stop with an unpleasant “Excuse me, this is business class”. Like a naughty school boy I returned to the lady and show her my boarding pass which allowed me to access the “exclusive area”. Check-in was smooth and I was airside in under 20 minutes. Enough time for some duty-free shopping in an airport already decorated for Christmas. Being a little bit hungry I was looking for the “light meals or snacks especially prepared for you” and “drink from our World Wine bar” as BA promised again on their website. The only  I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the “comfortable private lounge” and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which “features irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flight”. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapés was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option “beef or fish” with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my “very British experience” the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn’t stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service; you needed to ask for another drink as the crew was busy to stop the Club Europe toilet in the front from leaking and flooding the entire front galley.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew London Heathrow to Cape Town via Johannesburg. Effortless bag drop and customs/security transit in a very quiet T5. Silver card holder, so made my way to Terraces North. Plenty of seating available although sadly I was too early for the dinner service so ploughed my way through the rather poor \"afternoon tea\" sandwiches. Wine selections however were tip top. Boarding at remote C65 quickly turned into a scrum, with passengers crowding around the entry gates preventing passengers invited to board from doing so. BA part to blame for boarding the A380 so late before the scheduled departure time. On board flight down to JNB was up to scratch with a bright young mixed-feet crew and good service levels. The IFE on the A380 puts that on its sister BA fleet wide body aircraft to shame. On time arrival in JNB and then onto the morning BA (Comair) connection to CPT. Flying Comair is like flying BA in the 70's/80's with full hot service breakfast and a bit of old fashioned cabin service (endless cups of tea!). Early arrival in CPT made for nice end to a good journey.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was very disappointed to find that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a decade ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. On the outbound flight, only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. The only possible solution the steward could find (as there was a critical bolt missing) was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very 'Flintstones' for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view (very annoying when you are half way through a film). The flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it. They did at least have a nice bordeaux red wine. The staff did well enough. I used to fly BA a lot and am a Silver Card holder but it is no longer my airline of choice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "What a disappointing experience flying British Airways from London Gatwick to Mauritius. Flew club class and the service was merely adequate, they did what they had to do and no more - at no point we were made to feel valued customers. A request for a cup of tea after dinner, resulted in no tea brought (it was allegedly given to another passenger), when we had fruit as a dessert, it was given with no plate, bread at breakfast was also given without a plate - had to be put directly onto the tray. On the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine, weren't available to view. Given that we paid a lot of money for these tickets, the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly. BA now seems to be a budget airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price. Flew Emirates last year to Mauritius and there is no comparison. Emirates wins hands down. BA needs to get its act together as it will loose customers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I hadn't flown with BA for quite a number of years, so after seeing their new fleet, I was expecting something 'modern'. Instead, it was like being in a time warp. The aircraft had seen better days, in my opinion, and judging by the IFE equipment and the inner design, damaged lights and uncomfortable seats it showed. Our nearest toilet was out of action, not good. The crew were okay, the service was okay, it was just a convenient way of 'A to B' in my opinion, nothing else. Only until this airline manage to update everything they offer, utilise (aircraft wise) and provide as much emphasis on their everyday economy folk as they do on their frequent fliers, I may consider them again. Value for money is negligible, and after using other, forward thinking modern airlines, the experience made the end of a great holiday feel somewhat sour.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats, very low cost style and uncomfortable. Could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service. Catering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate bar for a 5 hours service. Will never fly BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The flights were all on time, except Belfast from London which never is. The Staff were efficient. My issue is the App, I could not book seats to Tel Aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay. So ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight. The seat was in front of the dividing barrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so I wasted my money on PE seat! You can get hold of BA customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just won't use them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA’s Galleries lounge at CPT is adequate but let down by a poor food selection (including packaged cheese and biscuits, with flimsy wooden knives) and limited wine choices. Champagne was conspicuously lacking. Toilet paper wasn’t being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on one of the cubicle doors. There were no information screens, so one had to wait for the tannoy call to board. Boarding itself was efficient, with priority for groups 1 and 2. Seats 62J/K on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job, and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins. Take off was on schedule. FAs went through the motions, with little enthusiasm. The food was the worst we've ever experienced in Club World. The 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors. The White Company bedding was a let-down and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts. There's little one can do to remedy a hard seat. Landing was ahead of schedule. Overall, a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub-par business class product. British Airways are falling ever behind their competitors.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Berlin to Johannesburg via London. The short haul flight between Berlin and London was oKay, they don't include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low-cost carriers high. Because of an engine problem, the flights from LHR to JNB was delayed by 2:45h. British Airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks. Inside the A380, the IFE boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The 2-3-2 seating in the front section of Club World on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2-4-2, but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers. A full cabin also means queues for the two loos, although they're a lot more spacious than in First. The drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours, but the revamped Club World food is definitely an improvement. The fish option for the main course was some of the best food I've had in the air. The White Company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats. Cabin crew were generally good and the CSM was particularly visible during the flight. Breakfast was improved with the option to pre-select items. Arrival was ahead of schedule.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Fantastic flight. Travelled solo from London Gatwick to Glasgow in British Airway’s Club Europe cabin and could not fault one aspect of the service. I arrived at Gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure. All BA Club World passengers are entitled to fast track security at Gatwick. This was quick and the staff were pleasant enough. The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience. Had there been ever-so-slightly more leg room and in-flight entertainment I’d have given this flight 10/10! A fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Two regular an uneventful flights. Curiously enough, though, with the exact same crew! The crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite, but I just cannot take it that British Airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers, where everything is charged for, apart from luggage. On the second leg of the trip, the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason, row 6 where I was sitting did not have AC.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Barbados return. I normally travel on BA with low expectations with the result that I am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised. The outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an OK cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful. However, the flight did leave bang on time and managed to land in Barbados before the Virgin flight that was scheduled to leave Gatwick five minutes before us, with the result that we got through arrivals quickly. The return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of BA with one of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years. Once again when you travel west to east, the crew (specifically one lady who was looking after our part of the cabin) somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal. The pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the PE cabin (not a big deal but irritating non the less). No bread was served with dinner, despite there being butter on the plate, so I presume it was missed. My wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before everyone else, which was fine. However, as the crew were serving the remaining meals, there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys. When they reached our row, they somehow thought it would be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap, although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid. It also spilled on my Kindle which thankfully had the cover closed. A very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and I suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made. My wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner. Once again we landed on time, which was a good thing. Overall, the return flight was extremely poor.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Pisa to London Gatwick. The two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure. We had hand baggage only and had already checked-in online and had boarding cards on our smartphones so proceeded to security. The queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to get through. Although we were flying Economy as BA Gold members we had access to the lounge. The lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge. We left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control, the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to get through. Once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers. We received the magic beep and were upgraded to Club Europe (both of us are Gold members). We were seated in row 7, it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed. Leg room not great but we are both short. After take off we were offered drinks. I had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle. We were then offered afternoon tea, consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef, egg and tuna and a slice of Victoria sponge cake. All very tasty but I do miss the scones in Club Europe. I also managed two top ups of champagne. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested. The flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landing. Overall we paid £50 each for the flight and with the upgrade was a bargain.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Edinburgh on British Airways domestic economy, check in at T5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick. I used the BA Galleries North lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon. Boarding through A8 on to a clean looking full A319. I had seat 25A which has no window. Crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on BA. Not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time baggage off quickly so flight not too bad. The footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards BA. In order to maintain my Executive club silver status (Oneworld Sapphire) I have to take 4 BA flights each year, which I can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so European and International flights I take each year will be either with other Oneworld carriers or others and not BA. The management at British Airways are making false claims, when suggesting \"it's what our passengers asked for\". I travelled with BA 16 times last year and I wasnt asked if I wanted a devaluation of the BA Executive Club - or was I asked if I wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats - I most certainly was never asked if I wanted the simple snack and a coffee on UK and European flights replaced by buy your own food - neither was I asked if I mind paying for snacks on International flights. Unfortunately British Airways are fast becoming a second rate budget airline in order to appease it's shareholders.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "New York to Nairobi via London. Flight Attendants were wonderful, friendly, cheery and helpful. But the business Class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger, even if you are seated next to a companion. There is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water. The IFE on the LHR-NBO leg reminds me of the game \"pong\" in its resolution and food is mediocre, at best. BA charges to select Business Class seats. For my family of 4, it would have cost over $1,600 to get 4 assigned seats on the 4 segments.: 1 occurrences\n",

Heathrow to Cape Town on old Boeing 747-400, and even though this is still one of my favorite aircraft, the business class on was the old one. The seat itself was comfortable and I prefer to be shielded from other passengers, but no stowage space for small items around your seat, not possible to watch TV during take off. There is not much to watch anyway, and a dirty seat and cabin. No USB plug or at least an international plug but only a UK plug. How international. The full flat bed is good if you are shorter than 187cm. This is the only airline in business class long haul that has 6 seat in a row. The service was good, but needs some nicer touches though. Look at what others are offering, British Airways are way behind. The cabin crew was professional and friendly and it all came down to the attendant on our side. She gave her all to ensure a good flightIt is sad that legacy carriers now go the same road as low cost carriers instead of opting for better quality.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bangkok to Manchester via London. I used to fly BA on this route on a regular basis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering. More recently we've been using Emirates or Etihad. We travel the route two or three times a year to visit family. BA were offering a good price on their Premium Economy seats so we switched. What a big mistake. Never, ever again. Despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40 - £50 surcharge. Reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we would sit together. In the end it was OK but we can't get over the cheek of charging to book a seat - Emirates and Etihad don't charge. The seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable. Leg room was OK but the seats were very narrow. Nothing like the comfort of Emirates or Etihad in Economy. Inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent. Picture quality was like watching a TV in the 1950's. Food was appalling. Little choice, insipid starters and mains swimming in water. Other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil! If you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the back of the plane. Cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful. The plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbare in places. Certainly on this route BA have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind Emirates and Etihad when it comes to comfort and service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We traveled to Lisbon for our dream vacation, a cruise to Portugal and Spain. Our friends did not EVER get their luggage. It was a two week cruise. Two weeks without a change of clothes or her CPAP machine. Contacting customer service was a nightmare. We never talked to a real person. Very little effort was put into getting them their bags. In one port we were on the ship and the bags were at the airport. The airlines did not deliver the bags nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go get them. The airline couldn’t be bothered to take the bags from the airport to the ship. BA says it is their policy to get you your bags within 72 hours. That is a joke! It’s been over two weeks and they still don’t have them. They are back home in the US and last they heard the bags were in Lisbon! If your have a choice, do not fly British Airways.

      "This latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slipping. Background: family living in USA = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for eastbound transatlantic leg. To date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with British Airways. Service has been almost consistently good or very good. We may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. Subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. The Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through \"Contact us\" resulted in \"we're sorry to hear you've had problems\" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. Refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded \"well, that's cutbacks for you\". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and water were available during the afternoon. No snacks available for children for 5 hours! \"Cutbacks\". Luckily I had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in USA). At 1830 cabin service (tea) started. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - \"Why didn't you order one?\" \"I did!\" \"She didn't have a child's meal at lunch\" \"Yes, she did!\" \"Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin\" Really? We were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of an apology. Customer service? Customer satisfaction? Result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? What do you think?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The return flight from St Lucia started well. To my surprise the Business Class lounge for 1st and Club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the British Airways flight was the only one leaving at this hour. It was very nice - considerably better than the dive at Antigua. It was light and airy, very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped bar. We enjoyed our stay there. It was some trek to the plane. As I entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1A a lady FA almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass - \"we have to see it,\" she said sharply, \"its a security process.\" I was startled at the aggressive tone as if I was trying to sneak on the plane. Very strange as I had passed three boarding pass checks anyway. Pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne. Plane left on time to the minute. There were five empty seats in 1st. I found my miserable looking, ever thinning pillow (they get smaller with every flight to save money) and went looking to sneakily find another. Can you believe this! Five empty seats. Four empty overhead bins. One remaining pillow in the fifth bin! (Which I grabbed). Even with two - on lie flat I had hardly any head support. My wife asked for a 2nd pillow. \"Sorry madam we have none to spare.\" Dinner started with Quinoa Salad and smoked trout. It was alright. Cream of broccoli soup likewise alright. Balsamic honey glazed chicken for mains was a disaster. Dried out. Unedible. FAs made up my bed. It was hard as rock and very uncomfortable. I slept not for one minute. Nor did my wife. Nor did the lady in the adjacent seat. I flew the A380 in 1st, last spring to Singapore and slept for 5 hours - but it was far more softer to sleep on. I can only surmise the seat, about five years old - was worn out. (The side areas were also very grubby). We both embarked totally shattered. The plane generally was very tired. Worn carpets that really should be replaced. The usual cheap amenities bag rounded off the usual poor experience with BA 1st Class. The IFE was very dated. One wonders if the BA board every think of flying with an Asian or Middle Eastern carrier to discover what true 1st Class should look like. FAs - apart from the rude one - were great. The landing at LGW was by a highly skilled pilot - and in 35 years of travel the softest touchdown I can recall.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Hong Kong. We have not flown long haul with British Airwaves for many years. This flight was a revelation. Staff attentive and good. Aircraft was spotless. Food was excellent. We did not recognise the product. We got a very good sleep on the flight. The BA bed is still one of the best despite the strange layout. Heartily recommend.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Kiev with British Airways. Good flight, cabin clean, seats small and uncomfortable but it was economy so you pay your money and takes your chance. Food was served and was tasty. Staff were friendly. Captain informative about a go around event we experienced. Separate lounge in Kiev airport.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "A very comfortable flight from London to Las Vegas with British Airways. Good food and drink and the usual excellent service. Thankfully, BA seem to have abandoned the practice of serving afternoon tea at about midnight departure time and now serve a much more appropriate light hot meal. Coming back, the seat/bed was surprisingly comfortable. However, on this older 747, the IFE was simply not up to it, with limited content other than films.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Houston with British Airways. Worst travel experience of my life. Firstly the seats were so bad and uncomfortable with poor cushioning - I couldn't relax or go to sleep for the duration of the flight. The movies were good but how am I supposed to watch it on a screen that's smaller than my iPad. The food was absolutely atrocious never in my life have I had such bad plane food. I wouldn't recommend for anyone to be quite frank.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from Miami to London. First time on the A380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777. The World Traveller Plus area is on the upper deck and BA had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft. The seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room. The service was the usual British Airways, the cabin crew being friendly and interactive. Overall a good quick flight and would definitely recommend BA but will stick to the 787 which I really love: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Denver. Seat space  poor (I'm 6ft 2\" and really struggled).  Film selection poor, screen size - poor temperature control, poor food.  Drinks infrequent Nothing in comparison to Emirates, Qatar, Turkish etc - on par with Ryanair at best (Ryanair doesn't have films but is almost as comfy but 8 hours of this BA flight is just painful). Better to find another airline and route if possible.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Cape Town. Check in at Heathrow T3 very efficient. Used my card to access the BA Lounge at T3 which is pretty average, although enjoyed a good supper with very good claret so did not need to eat on plane. Boarding a bit of a mess at remote gate 35 where both the PA and aircon were not working, but nonetheless everyone seemed to be seated before the inevitable missing passenger/bag offload, which caused a 30min push back delay. Service seemed efficient on board (although I did not eat dinner) and we had a friendly young crew member on our aisle. Managed to get some rest and with enjoyed breakfast before landing at CPT, 30 mins late. All in all, reasonable value for money. The usual hopeless British Airways IFE which needs constant re-sets and is from the age of the ark.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. This was the only drink offered that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. It took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this flight we tried to avoid the “back of plane” issues by paying an additional £56.00 for exit row seats. The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. No apology or explanation was given. Not the way we wanted our holiday to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund for the £56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and I await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. This is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. BA were not the cheapest flights by far, we opted to fly with them due to reputation, which was sorely let down.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Singapore to Heathrow. British Airways gave me something I wasn't expecting - probably my worst long-haul flight experience ever. Clearly BA's cost-cutting measures have been primarily concerned with turning economy travel into the genuine 'cattle-class' experience. They really need to up their game to compete with Singapore Airlines and Emirates - who deliver economy class travel at a completely different level. BA - where do I start? Cramped seats - even felt extremely small to the children (6 and 8) and little leg room. That feels quite tortuous after 5 hours of travel, let alone 12. The food was laughable - yes, it says on the marketing blurb there are 12+ menus to choose from, but it fails to mention that they are inedible. I thought the children's meals of macaroni cheese would be a safe bet - the grey gelatinous block that turned up made even the cabin crew blush. The entertainment system just about kept the children entertained - but the high hopes of kiddie rucksack, quality 'kids' treat food and a warm welcome for the under 12s was completely lacking.If you have a choice go with another airline. Go with Emirates.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We were very excited about our Club World journey to Mauritius and how disappointed we were. The food wasn't great, the wines weren't either and the foot part of my \"flat bed\" kept on collapsing so I hardly got any sleep. The cabin staff were good and very helpful. We have travelled Virgin Upper Class and it is much better as your bed is made up with a duvet and sheets. All we got on British Airways was a sort of rather nasty blanket and no sleep suit either. Very disappointed in all of it. Our flight was terribly delayed because the incoming flight to Gatwick was struck by lightening which is not BA's fault I know but I would have thought they could provide another plane to save having to wait so long as they have done in the past. Maybe they just don't have spare planes any more long haul. We have travelled British Airways Europe several times in the past 3 years and think this is wonderful but long haul just does not do it for us and certainly we hope next time we go long haul we won't have to travel British Airways unless they pull up their socks.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Return journey Gatwick to Dubrovnik. Outward journey seating was basic but were at least served a basic cardboard tasting breakfast and one drink. Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps. I think this is slowly acclimatising people to refreshments being withdrawn completely early next year on short haul flights. Staff were very friendly but they must be embarrassed by the lowering of standards on British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We recently flew British Airways business class from Calgary to Rome via London and returned the same route. Like previous reviews we too will avoid British Airways at all costs. Although the cabin service and staff on all of our routes was exceptional the layout of the international business class seating is brutal! Who designs seating where you have to either bother your fellow traveler to get out or climb over their feet?  Even worse is what British Airways sells as business class within Europe. They are nothing more than economy seats with the middle one blocked off. My husband is 6'4\" and I'm 5'10\" and our knees were jammed up against the seat in front of us. Could you make your passengers feel anymore cramped?! My biggest complaint about British Airways is having to pay to reserve my seats! They are the only international carrier that does this. Even in business class. When I logged on 24 hours in advance, there were no seats to choose from - and to my utter surprise my husband and I weren't even seated together. Shame on you British Airways for being so cheap! We are flying to Europe again shortly and will definitely be looking elsewhere! On the plus side, food and service on our flights was exceptional but your customer service leaves much to be desired.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London City to Malaga return. Things started badly when my 2 year old son was out on a separate booking reference. The call centre in India refused to help fix it, saying I couldn't manage his booking because it wasn't in my name! Then we had a three hour delay at LCY - something to do with them miscalculating the weight allowance. During that time BA didn't give us any food or drink, and gave us no updates as to what was happening. We landed just under three hours late, so couldn't get compensation. Return journey at Malaga, another one hour delay. After we got back tried to collect Avios points on website, but kept getting 'system error'. Then tried calling BA customer relations, and after going through the menu system was told that \"due to disruption your call cannot be answered\".  That's the last time I fly this terrible, uncaring airline.  The only upside is that London City is a great airport on a weekend!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Come on British Airways. Really. I have flown BA long haul on two journeys in the last four weeks. First from LIM-LHR and now LHR-DEN. I know that BA has refurbished some of their B747-400 and B777 but the rest are a disgrace. As a flag carrier, what message does this send to the rest of the world? On a positive note, the cabin crew are always polite (sometimes to the point of being passive-aggressive), but this is a humourless service. Even London Underground has moved from the dated uniforms. The in-flight catering is lack-lustre. I choose vegan because the standard meals are truly awful. You now even have to pay for the snacks between meals (unlike KLM or LATAM). I understand the economics are difficult, given that some nations subsidise flag carriers, but small and low-cost changes would make a major difference. Firstly, smarten up the staff (have you seen the LAN uniforms?). On the last flight, one crew member hadn't shaved and it wasn't designer stubble. Get some humour training into the crew and just make passengers flight comfortable. The IFS systems are so dated that they match the reruns of old BBC sitcoms/ soaps offered. On a positive note: 1) I believe BA is a safe airline and the crew professional. Big bonus point for me. 2) When there is a problem, BA is efficient in sorting it out. 3) Communication from the cockpit is usually good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Dublin. On time departure and on time arrival. Good flight and good service. However, there are more cutbacks, no cooked breakfast on 06.45 departure, ham and cheese crosissant instead. The coffee cups have shrunk. I managed to get another coffee from the Galley, and some biscuits. Still recommend BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Naples to London Gatwick. The aircraft was fairly new (which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint: having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality. What other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle? You can't keep waking people up and have no alternative but to ungracefully climb out! The older I get, the harder this is becoming.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew from Gatwick to Porto return. The flights were on time, crew on board were polite and helpful, the captain kept us informed on both the outward and return flights. The cabin and toilets were clean. Porto airport was well run and efficient, Gatwick which had filthy toilets was not such a pleasant experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "One way, London Heathrow to Amsterdam with British Airways. Flight itself was good. Food tasty and staff friendly. This is a short flight and the flight attendants have a lot to do in a little amount of time, so they can be forgiven for being seemingly hasty. The only complaint is the incredibly crowded lounge. Lockers in the lounge would be a great improvement, especially for solo travelers.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from London Heathrow to Seattle. Poor boarding procedure at T5 with the indicators suggesting flight was not ready to board but on arriving at gate we walked straight on, passing others who were waiting and seemingly not sure whether to board or not. Econ seemed about 75% full. Sat half way down but told no choice available for main meal which was served after about 3 hours of taking off. Cabin crew very apologetic and blamed management for recent cost cutting measures, saying this is happening a lot and upsetting many passengers. Travelling with 3 children who didn't like the only option offered, so much frustration with British Airways taking a budget airline approach but charging all full service price. Complained to Customer Service after arriving home and was told the caterer at LHR was to blame and they didn't want to delay the flight waiting for the extra meals. Seems a bit lame and complete contradiction to what the crew said. Crew made an extra effort to bring a few snacks from business to my children which was highly appreciated. Hard to recommend BA but given the competition on this route, and the desire to stay with One World/BA FFP, it's a poor choice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Porto and Barcelona to Gatwick a week later with British Airways. Both flights on time. While the seats are comfortable, the cabin modern, and the cabin crew professional, the service has really been minimized. Just one quick drink run (tiny serving) and a small snack (tiny bag of crisps or biscuits), nothing else. They even missed several rows when handing out the snacks and I had to remind them. Crew spend most of the time arranging things in the galley. Maybe it's time to start offering food for purchase?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to New York JFK with British Airways. Check in at LGW is a complicated, slow process but once through security things get better. I dislike their business class seat layout. Old aircraft, very worn out seats with little or no padding but the excellent cabin crew made up for all of this. They were going out of their way to serve, to make sure every passenger was comfortable, well fed and plenty of drinks. Food was good. Flight on time, but arrival at JFK is chaotic, long immigration lines, etc.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Johannesburg. We enjoyed the flight very much on the A380. We chose two seats together and it was comfortable. The inflight entertainment was good and had a fair choice. The food was ok and there were plenty of drinks to go round. Staff were professional and helpful.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to New York JFK. Very poor service from beginning to end. Cabin interior is tired and the media screen was tiny. Food was ok but we had one beer and were then told there was no beer left on the plane! Asked three flight attendants for a drink later in the flight but only one attendant bothered to return - and that was to say there were no drinks left. Service on the return flight was no better. I am planning a business class trip to Thailand in November and I note the Emirates price is £550.00 less than BA. The British Airways plane is again a Boeing 777-200, which are now old and outdated and the Emirates are all A380 or 777-300ER, less than 5 years old with the most up to date entertainment and excellent in flight service. And they send a chauffeur driven car to take you to the airport! - why would anyone fly BA if they had a choice?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Zurich to London Heathrow. Very friendly staff, great choice of complimentary drinks (even spirits such as Gin & Tonic, two sorts of whiskey are included), flight was on time, modern/refurbished cabin.

      "Being a gold Exec Member and this was a redemption flight one should not really complain. But if I was paying 4000 UK for this I would be out raged. The Aircraft at B777-200 well past its sell by date. The Crew whilst personable and very pleasent look bored. The food is a disgrace, wines (white warm), reds (cold) so bad as when I asked for the Business class menu to compare it with First, was superior in every way. Example being First - Soup versus Business Crab Tian? The CSD just apologised and said I know its a disgrace but we keep telling them. Aircraft was so old the ceiling fell in with the celoptape loosing its grip and some foam plate hung out. It really is past a laugh asking people to pay their rates. Overall I find BA moving to a 3 star, its overall product is lazy, apathetic, inconsistent and tired. The crew are fantastic in the air as for the ground well its like a tube station or a civil servant job for life atitude. My advice stay well well away for premium prices, their Euro Business is laughing stock.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Las Vegas. Outbound great welcome and service. Homebound friends reported same great service from female attendant on their side of cabin. Unfortunately, my wife and I were looked after young male attendant whose manner was rather officious and for whom everything seemed to be too much trouble. Detracted only somewhat from overall very enjoyable BA booked Vegas trip - think maybe the guy is in the wrong career. Boeing 747s OK but a bit tatty all round. I hope they're near retirement.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Gatwick to Barbados return. British Airways is a terrible airline and I will never use it again. Paid extra for premium economy and another £192 to make sure we could sit together, which I have never had to do with airlines on long haul. We were told there may be a small charge when we booked the holiday. The plane was very dated and dirty the floor was dirty, my tray was covered in coffee stains. On the outward flight, one footrest would not stay up, and inward the foot rest and leg support would not work. The crew gave us a champagne welcome then vanished until the food came, tough if you would have liked another drink. It seemed the crew were very tired or just fed up serving people, I suggest they change jobs.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Alicante. Crew friendly but a bit amateur for business class Club Europe cabin. Upon boarding I found my row of seats dirty with lollipop stick, empty hankie wrappers, newspaper and empty water bottle all strewn across seat. Aircraft had sat at gate for an hour since landing from Glasgow, why isn't it cleaned and why don't the crew check the state of the business cabin at the very least? Pilot came on the tannoy and said because there were meals being served we had to wait for 6-7 more to be delivered. This delayed the departure by 20 minutes. More afternoon teas were carried on (and crockery). Cue lots of banging and clattering in the forward galley. Crew only offered a drink once which I thought was poor for a business cabin. Not very proactive. Call bell went unanswered twice. I asked for a Baileys and ice to round off the meal when I managed to catch the attention of purser. As duty free trolley rolled back I was handed two bags of nuts instead by another CC. Gave up at that point.: 1 occurrences\n",

Young cabin crew dealt well with demanding passengers, drinks trolley falling over and a child who insisted on standing up in his seat for takeoff.

Yes, they are reducing the service but what other forms of medium-long transport (trains, ferries) includes food in the deal?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London to Baltimore. Have read so much about this aircraft and was looking forward to flying it. What a fantastic plane, the large windows and higher cabin pressure made the plane feel bright and light with no dry plane eyes after the flight.

      "Montreal to London and return to Toronto. O/W leg from Montreal was the most average club experience to date. Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was good on the face of it, except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn, the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered (left in oven in error) and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition, poor food and drink service by the third party provider, with dirty / scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777-200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class.  Friendly crew, prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef, Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out - only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. In fact, the crew were the only saving grace. BA don't seem to get it. Even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the UK's flag carrier. Biz and First Class products are dropping at an alarming rate. Wake up BA and IAG - before it's too late.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Washington Dulles with British Airways. This was our return journey to the U.S. as we had flown over to London on a BA B747-400 in First from DFW. We were warmly greeted upon boarding and escorted to our seats. The A380 interior in First cabin was immaculate with even more personal space at our seats when compared with the 747. Once again, the on board service was excellent as was the food and wine (although once again the steak was a bit overcooked). I truly hope we will be able to fly in First again one fine day with BA.: 1 occurrences\n",

I hope to fly with BA in First again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight from LGW to St Lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in. No priority tags available and I had to ask for them. (I need not have bothered as the bags came off the plane last anyway). The BA 1st Class lounge was \"still closed\" pending refurbishment. (I do not think BA have any intention of re-opening the lounge at LGW.) The No \"1\" alternative is okay. Boarded and shown to seat. Noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight. All scruffy. Flight took off on time to the minute. FAs throughout were fine - but no personal address by name. Seats look a little \"old\" - I suspect this plane was one of the first to have the \"new\" 1st Class. The IFE was certainly dated. Meal was \"sort of okay.\" No \"Amuse Bouche\" anymore as BA want to cut further costs. Had to settle for some motley peanuts. They soon run out of the premium champagne - I suspect they only had two bottles on board. Crab appetizer was alright - nothing special. The usual butternut squash soup. This was my 5th 1st Class flight this year and my 5th identical soup. I suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at BA HQ. Main course of sole was dry and tasteless. Wines were fine and for once nicely chilled. Another disappointing experience from BA - but to be honest over time you get used to a \"business class\" product in BA 1st Class. I noted, when I selected my seats, that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a one way price was a staggering £4500. The flight was full - and if I paid £4500 for this - I would be in despair. I was asked recently why fly BA 1st Class at all. Its down to cubic meters of space. - and that's it. The alternative is BA's Business Class / Club World and that is an industry joke with the ying yang seats. Off to Perth in the Spring and flying First. Guess who we are not flying with.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Cape Town with British Airways. Paid extra to book 2 particular seats. Both were broken. I had to sit upright for 11+hours and my husband had to sit partially reclined to eat his meals. I had veggie meal which was served half hour before everyone else - no drink until everyone else served. Choice of meal for husband was chicken curry or chicken curry. He doesn't like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal. Same at breakfast - served half hour early so had to eat alone. When other breakfasts came out, guess what no meat. On complaining to BA Customer Services, told could choose another meal if we had gone on line and paid extra. Been offered the insulting and derisory compensation of £20 off our next flight (as if there will be a next flight) - not even offered a refund of payment we made for booking broken seat. Both airline and customer service disgraceful.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Shocking. There is nothing good to say about this trip: - People with 3 pieces of hand luggage were allowed to board. Business Class seat pitch is tiny, there is insufficient space to work. Catering at this 15.30 hrs departure was a plate with 3 finger sandwiches, that was it for a 2 hour and 10 minute flight in Business Class. Moving map did not work. Plane parked far away from the terminal amongst cargo planes, bus only departed once all people had disembarked. No priority Business Class bus. Altogether a terrible experience. Going forward: TAP - you have my business.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Hong Kong with British Airways on theirn A380. I have had more legroom / seatspace on a 2 hour holiday charter flight to Spain. Don't know why I had to endure such a cramped position for 12 hrs. Then to top it all, i'm sorry sir we havent got any breakfast left. Not a happy chappie. Return journey same cramped conditions. For a long haul flight I would not recommend BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Good service flying from London to Madrid, attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg. Outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient. On the return leg the crew were one of the most attentive and approachable I have met on a BA flight in quite some time. Food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered. The only gripe I have is that unless you are a One World Emerald card holder you can't select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector. I think it's a British Airways thing. Even the LCCs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost. Paying business class prices I expect to get seat selection as a standard regardless of my status. I think this policy is misguided and I will take this into consideration in booking future flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outward flight Kuwait to London was on a refurbished 747: flight was on time, cabin crew were hard-working, breakfast was a full British, and excellent, in-flight entertainment was AVOD, and with a wide selection of movies and a huge selection of classical tracks. The flight was smooth, and the information from the flight deck kept us up to date on the progress of the flight. The cabin crew even managed to find the last miniature of single-malt scotch for me (good job, guys). Transit through Heathrow was hassle-free, and the flight to Edinburgh was on time, this time on an Airbus 319. Again, the service was on time, the cabin crew efficient, the flight smooth, and the bags came out at Edinburgh with no hassle. The return flight was equally good: prompt departure from Edinburgh, easy transfer at Heathrow, and on-time departure to Kuwait. This time, an un-refurbished 747, with the small seat-back screen, so I did not bother using the entertainment system. The evening meal was the dreaded \"chicken or pasta\" (come on, BA, can't we have a change) but edible and tasty, and the cabin crew were professional and unobtrusive, passing through the cabin regularly with juice and water on this overnight flight. Overall, the flight was up to the usual standards I expect from BA: I was safe, comfortable, adequately fed and watered, and all four journeys were on time and hassle-free, with a professional set of cabin crew and clean, tidy and well-maintained aircraft. Well done, BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew London Heathrow to Berlin Tegel with British Airways. No queues at terminal 5 at lunchtime - everything was very quick and efficient. Flight was punctual and well organised and service good with one exception. The flight info said there would be a “snack” but all we got was a small bag of crisps. Although it was a near two-hour flight over lunchtime, there was no food offered nor could we purchase any. (No shortage of drinks, including wine, though). You have been warned.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew JNB to ATH via LHR. Really disappointed and expected so much more. After reading previous comments have to agree that British Airways standards have slipped dramatically. Having flown first on same routing a while back its very evident to see the cost cutting in all aspects that its definitely not worth it to pay that sort of pricing. Food not at all up to standard and can honestly say have had a better experience having flown business with Gulf and Asian carriers. Its a real shame as when you speak to staff on board all agree and are quite embarrassed. On a positive point, staff on all legs were really nice and helpful, just let down by a poor product.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bangkok to London. First time flown with British Airways and the last. Service was slow, IFE is poor to say the least compared to other airlines, and to be honest the last time will use them. Check in was fine as done most of it online myself, boarding ok. On value for money I would recommend another carrier.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I have been flying British Airways short haul in Club Europe for several years and until recently have been more than satisfied with the service provided. Noticeably, this year that service has become far more erratic culminating in an extremely poor performance and unpleasant experience on this recent flight to Malta ex Gatwick. Departure time was 0750 and we arrived at Premium Check-in at 0620 to find only one member of staff manning the desks serving First and Club. There were at least 10 parties waiting in the queue, some of whom defected to Economy desks which were heavily manned with faster moving queues. Only after more than 15 minutes did extra staff arrive and when we reached the desk the attitude of the Check-in lady left much to be desired - robotic, unsmiling and disinterested is probably a kind description. It would have been good to have been informed that the No 1 Lounge was available in the absence of the BA offering, but no mention of a lounge was made at all. The No 1 Lounge struggles to cope with the additional passenger load, but that is another story. Boarding was fine, but the in-flight service from a totally disinterested cabin crew was perfunctory at best. The meal service was late and slow with no drinks of any sort offered until after all meals had been dispensed. Clearing the meal was even worse. The flight was in final approach to Luqa when, returning from the toilet, I saw one of the cabin crew sitting in the galley playing solitaire on her I-pad whilst bottles and glasses remained at seats which then had to be hurriedly removed as the Captain announced \"cabin crew to seats for landing\". Should I have apologised for being a mere passenger interrupting this lady's games session? Appalling - and such a contrast to several LHR-PRG early morning flights over recent years when it has been a joy to fly BA. This may just have been a bad flight, but I fear that this is the future for BA unless somebody at the top reads these reports and takes remedial action before it's good name is lost forever.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew with British Airways for the first time from Sydney to London return. Very unsatisfactory compared to premium economy experiences with other airlines. Had to pay to preselect seats and not only was there no priority boarding, the World Traveller Plus customers in fact were the last to board. There were only 6 rows of premier economy, yet was told that the meal choice has ran out. The meal took me back to air travel in the 1970s. The starter consisted of 6 tasteless pasta spiral and 1 cherry tomato. The fish was dry and tasteless and the rice an unappetising grey colour. The dessert was a square of plain cheesecake. Hot beverages at breakfast were served in thin paper cups. There was no other service, no offer of water or snacks between the meals. Toiletry consisted of hand wash and nothing else. The toilets were not cleaned and replenished during the stop over in Singapore. The seat was comfortable enough but has only a foot rest rather than the leg rest of other airlines. BA World Traveller Plus is certainly not value for money and I will not travel with them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "New York JFK to London Heathrow with British Airways. Please bear in mind that this complaint concerns a business class ticket. Customer service is non existant. I could not choose seat on line. Called for help and was told it was not possible for them to do it over the phone. Suggested I use another browser. I called a friend who could try using her pc and another browser. Same story. Unable to choose seat. Called airline again and was told that it could only be done by airport staff. After pressing them for the number and being assured I was being given the contact info for BA at JFK, I called only to discover I had been given the general phone number for JFK. Absurd. I hadn't used this airline in years and never will again. It's a shame. They used to be such a class act.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I haven't flown British Airways for quite a while but this journey to Nice drew home to me that BA is no longer the premier airline I thought it to be. Trip was okay, no major problems but my point being is that it is no different to some of the many other airlines I have flown such as EasyJet, Turkish Airlines, Flybe etc. Cabin interior was a bit tired, I asked the air hostess for a Diet Coke and didn't receive one. One toilet between 120 odd people in economy isn't great on a 1 hour 40 minute flight. Cluttered galley of people waiting for the one toilet, congestion in the aisle blocking the flight attendants trolley, not ideal. Don't get me wrong the flight and airline was okay but no different than the other lower cost airlines, when comparing ticket prices BA no longer has the edge for me.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Travelling with British Airways is always a good experience, took a short break to Majorca out on 10/10 returning 14/10 from LHR T5. Flew out on G-EUYY A320 and back on G-EUXF A321 both excellent flights, the crew were very smart and welcoming and the aircraft clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the lunch and bar service going out and refreshments and bar service on return. Noting other reviews its a shame people board flights hungry as their are many outlets at the airports prior to boarding, even major retailers do good \"meal deals\". The crew make the difference ensuring a safe comfortable flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I cannot believe that British Airways have such a meagre seat pitch on such a great aircraft. I have been on many short haul flights that would have been far more comfortable let alone a 12 hour flight to Seoul. I am not overweight but I am 6ft-2ins tall and when the passenger in front of me reclined his seat there was absolutely no space remaining. The total lack of space ruined an otherwise flawless flight and would certainly make me check alternative airlines for long haul comfort in future.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Seattle to Prague via London Heathrow with British Airways. Check-in took about an hour (online checkin was not available). The catering onboard is the worst from all European legacy airlines. The breakfast on the long haul flight was a bad joke (bread with cheese and a muesli bar). On the 2 hour flight only little chips or biscuits. I talked to the cabin crew on most of the 4 flights, they encouraged me to write reviews, because they do not agree with the company catering policy too. Also the performance of the crew is of a very low quality. The aircrafts were new, that is of course more important that food.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "PHL to LHR and return, both in new cabin. British Airways has degraded its economy product to the point where US airline companies may actually offer a better service. On the 777, BA has removed the toilets in the rear to cram in more seats, causing long queues for the remaining restrooms. The new economy seating feels incredibly cramped, the food on offer is of poor quality and of smaller portions, and avios accruals have been significantly reduced for low-cost fares - I just don't see any reason to continue to fly this airline. I find it ridiculous that BA charges insanely high prices to reserve seats in advance, making me have to stress out about checking in on time while on vacation to ensure that I can snap up whatever good seat is left by that time. My next trip to Europe has been booked with American - I was able to choose a regular seat for free at the time of booking, and I will accrue the full amount of miles that I am actually flying. Although BA staff were courteous and competent on this trip, that does not make up for the current sad state of the economy product.: 1 occurrences\n",

Boarding via gate 23, the flight departed around 40 minutes late but arrived around 10 minutes late which was fine. Snack and coffee served during the 1hr 10 min flight. Return check in a bit slow but once checked in used the galleries lounge for a quick coffee. Boarding at gate 5 on to a full 767 with business seating which was nice, departed on time for a flight of just over an hour, bags tagged priority so off quick.

      "British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai from Terminal 5 in coach class. Check in uneventful. No boarding priority for people travelling with children, a first for me for any long haul flight. Five minutes before departure, captain announces that someone has checked in a bag but has not turned up so they need to take off the offending suitcase. Fair enough. The staff had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be in a container in which it wasn't. Result they started taking off all the containers one by one and searching for the flight. Captain told that he cannot give any estimate. 90 minutes passed after that no announcement, a tired and jaded cabin crew literally disappeared. After 90 mins they realised that people might be hungry and started serving juice. Finally after 1 hr 45 mins captain said that they had found the rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. The plane suddenly started a push back without any warning. The aircraft was a jaded B747-400, poor seats, poor entertainment equipment which had to be rebooted thrice before it worked. Once airborne the crew said that people were hungry so there will not be a drink service they will be serving lunch - possibly an excuse to do less work. Lunch was ok. Second flight service was a snack before landing for which they lost the child meal I had requested, and shamefully tried to create one by adding a fruit shot to an adult meal. Overall poor airline, with tired and jaded aircraft and an equally tired and jaded looking staff.: 1 occurrences\n",

The British Airways terminal was hopeless, impossible to find your way around with no signs anywhere, and hideously overcrowded. Onboard my entertainment system never worked, then a few minutes into the flight both my wife's and my neighbour's entertainment systems also stopped working. Tried to read but my overhead light was broken. Tried to sleep but my neighbour's light was broken and on - could not be turned off.

After waiting on hold to complain to a supervisor for over 20 mins, we still didn't get to discuss why it takes so long for a refund?

      "Phoenix to London Heathrow, and this was our third time flying First Class on British Airways, and after flying this time, we are disappointed.  The BA lounge in Phoenix is disgusting. We could handle it only for about 5 minutes. From the staff, the seats, the space, the food, nothing was orderly, clean, and it all seemed run-down. Walking around the airport aimlessly was a much better option. The boarding process was a joke. Again, the staff seemed confused, clueless, they called for everyone (all statuses, memberships, traveling with children, etc...all at once. It seemed nearly half of the plane was lined up to get in during premier boarding. There were 3 cabin staff for first class, two out of the three were not at all cordial. No greeting, they seemed to be running around the entire time even when the first class cabin was not full. They were not well groomed or spoke politely - came across unprofessional. This ruined the experience of flying first class. The meal experience was horrible. I ordered an appetizer, salad, and an main course. My husband ordered the 2 appetizers, and a main course. They came back to tell us they were out of one of the appetizers he ordered. First time this has ever happened in first class! They brought my appetizer, which we had to share, and they completely forgot about my salad. They brought the main (chicken dish), which was cold and dry. I had to send it back and changed to a steak. The steak came after about 20 minutes. Roughly 1/4 of the steak was hot, the remainder was cold (not even warm). The taste was amazing but ruined the dining experience completely. Upon waking up I opted to not have breakfast but have biscuits. The menu had \"assortment of biscuits\" and a few other bistro type items. When I ordered coffee and biscuits, the flight attendant looked concerned and said \"let me see if I can find some biscuits for you\". She came back with a bag of popcorn, a browny, and a few vanilla wafers. Typical items served on a domestic US based airline. My husband ordered coffee as well and asked for half and half. She failed to understand half and half and finally said \"oh you mean half and half in British accent. How is it possible to be a flight attendant and you cannot understand an American accent for half and half. Normally this would not even be an issue but having experienced all of the above this just seemed like the icing on the cake. Toilets were small, cramped, and dirty with no typical First Class amenities available within the toilets. Our next leg was within EU to Munich on another BA flight where the service on a 737 surpassed their international First Class! Seat is comfortable but that's about it!: 1 occurrences\n",

Lounges at Madrid Barajas T4 and Heathrow T5 excellent, but overcrowded and a bit frayed at the edges at Los Angeles. No problems with baggage or delays. The Boeing 767s used between London and Madrid are so old they're almost retro, with LED screen TVs and blue leather seats, but comfortable, spacious and clean. The A380s seemed almost new, the seats are a little narrow but comfortable, and the inflight entertainment is excellent. Good amenity kit and simple but good quality food.

      "Copenhagen to Chicago via London Heathrow. British Airways club world is the worst business class cabin I've flown. TVs are tiny and the picture quality is awful - thankfully I had my laptop with me, as the TV was unwatchable. The tables hang at an angle, so expect your food and drink to slide off (although the floor is probably the best place for their food). I would advise you to eat at the airport and not rely on the inflight slop.  You'll have someone climbing over you (or you'll have to climb over other people) to get to the toilet (this is business class!).  And then they'll lose your bag, tell you it's going to take 4-5 days to get it to you and provide no information about what to do in the meantime. If you try and call to get answers, leave at least 45 minutes time to sit in a queue (and then expect to be put through to the wrong person, despite selecting the correct option in the automated menu!). Avoid British Airways wherever you can!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Vienna to Newcastle via Heathrow return, flights on-time. Economy on an A320. FA’s much better on domestic legs, while both times on VIE legs the FA’s were professional, but nothing more and not doing more than absolutely required. Information from the flight deck was friendly and excellent. A snack and drinks were served - snack a highly processed sandwich (barely edible) on the VIE flights and crisps/biscuits on the NCL flights. Additional drinks on request. A320 featured the new slim seats and I miss the older more comfortable BA seats with better leg room. BA has recently changed the rules and travelling only with hand baggage now also means that one is no longer allowed to pick a seat during check-in, but a seat is randomly allocated. Selecting any seat (even a middle seat in the back of plane now costs EUR 18). If one later decides to check a piece of luggage the costs are a whopping EUR 75 at the airport or EUR 35 online. Being Oneworld Sapphire does not help either. No privileges here; still the same charges for seat selection and checked luggage. So, BA became a low cost model, except for drinks service. However the prices do not reflect this change in service. On the last leg LHR-VIE carry-on luggage was heavily policed. Although my carry-on luggage met the weight requirements and fits in the overhead bin and has so without any problems on the previous three legs and twenty previous BA flights, I was required to check it in. It was also not a question of occupied space, as it happened in the priority line. Hopefully just a power trip by the gate agent. However, here goes the main advantage of BA, which was a carry-on policy that enabled passengers to realistically travel without the hassle of checking bags. Boarding by the same agent was again bizarre. Instead of priority boarding, there were now four different types of priority boarding, and the procedure left everybody confused and everybody just stood there blocking the access to the gate, so that finally it became a cattle call with everyone boarding at the same time. Another thing is, that recent changes in BA’s frequent flyer program make it impossible to reach a meaningful status even for regular flyer unless you regularly fly Club on long distance routes. Obviously, BA is trying very hard to annoy its frequent travelers. While I stopped flying Business with BA probably a year ago after they downgraded their Club Europe cabin and I was avoiding their long distance flights for a long time due to their terrible seating arrangement, I believe BA’s European economy was a great product and I was using BA regularly for those flights. However, after all these recent changes, I will only book BA if they offer the lowest or close to the lowest fare. For flights to the UK, KLM starts to look pretty good again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Barcelona, and for some reason British Airways continue to run this Barcelona service from the dated Terminal 3 at Heathrow, rather than new T5. That apart, this service was fine. Boarding was quick and efficient. Seats in Economy are now pretty similar to those on low cost airlines. But this handluggage only ticket cost no more than one with Ryanair from Stansted would have. Food and drink was the now standard minimalist option on most European flights these days. Just one question - why, when this is the British national flag-carrier, does the drinks trolley not stock some British beer, rather than identikit continental fizzy lagers? Departure and arrival in BCN was on schedule, and exiting the airport a breeze.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Newcastle. Been a while since I last flew British Airways, sad to see the same old planes in use and now very much looking their age for domestic use. Technical issues delayed departure, normal sure, but the noise the plane made on taxi lasted far too long and was slightly alarming and not the norm. Seat pitch belongs on a dodgy charter not the national carrier surely? Last time flown I got a nice sandwich and drink, this time it's small bag of crisps and juice? It's time BA stopped taking it's domestic (no competition routes) for granted and upgrade the fleet on short trips, the numbers onboard justify a better level of service considering the extra fees now attached for checked in luggage versus just carry on, puts me off using their long haul option with ever increasing fees whilst oil prices have been rock bottom for how long now? Kudos to the pilot for landing in Monsoon like conditions with very limited visibility - if only the aircraft quality matched their pilots!: 1 occurrences\n",

      "I booked a non-refundable round trip ticket, New York to London; Paris to New York. I showed up at JFK 2 hours before my flight and was informed that my ticket had been \"refunded,\" which meant I had no ticket. When I spoke to British Airways customer service, they said they would investigate how this happened, which would take 24-48 hours, but that meanwhile I had no ticket. They would not rebook my ticket. They were entirely unsympathetic, even though they had made a huge error cancelling my ticket. I was forced to purchase an expensive ($1300), last minute ticket, for which I have still not been reimbursed, even though, finally, British Airways acknowledged that they had made a big error. I can understand making an error. I cannot understand their unwillingness to help me, when they put me in such a compromised position. Subsequent to the problem on first leg, British Airways Customer Service assured me that my return ticket was not affected, and they even sent me an E-Ticket confirmation of my return. But, again, the morning of my return flight, they told me I had no return ticket. Only then did a Supervisor finally admit that an error had been made, and he rebooked my return, at no cost. Over the course of 2 weeks, however, I spent at least 10 hours trying to get my problem sorted out, first at Heathrow Airport, then on the phone and on email, and I was still left stranded for my return flight. I am amazed that British Airways was so insensitive to the problem which they created through a huge error, and that I have still not received a refund for the outbound ticket I was forced to purchase.: 1 occurrences\n",

Prior to the trip I was concerned about using BA again after 30 or more years of happily using other airlines. I was very happy with everything. If I'm picky about anything it would be that the strange yin-Yang seats in Club World were narrow at the shoulder for me, but once in the lie flat position I found the seat very comfortable.

      "British Airways Business class from Bangkok to London. The Lounge at Bangkok poorly signposted and a long walk from check in. A very relaxed lounge and plenty of food and drink options. The crew on the flight to London were friendly. The layout of the seating as has been commented on previously is very poor. Who wants to sit facing a fellow passenger for 11 hours? Terminal 5 Heathrow on departure is a disgrace. Surly staff on security and not a pleasant experience. The lounge was crowded, it was a Saturday, far too busy and not a relaxing environment. No Television to stop you getting bored. There are no warnings about how long it will take to get to your terminal. There are not enough boarding information screens to keep you updated. The flight was good and good crew. This sounds like a moan but the flight, except for the layout of the seats, was excellent. More work needed on the little things that matter.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from GIG to LHR. Nice easy check in with no extra charge for an overweight case. Got 4 seats together even though we couldn't check in online. Enough legroom for a tall man. Staff were all great and very friendly and helpful. 2 meals which were pretty good for an airplane and drinks on request. I emailed a request to let my father in law see the cockpit after landing and they pulled out all the stops for him. Made his holiday. Our Wheelchair was waiting at the aircraft door when we got off. Couldnt fault them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have been flying to the US regularly from England and have noticed a consistent erosion in the quality of its booking process, website, call centre and ground staff. The British Airways website is unreliable and prone to returning baffling errors even when carrying out the simplest of activities. Its upgrade path is impenetrable and designed to confuse, call centre staff do not seem to speak English and make ridiculous requests and ground staff are didactic. Examples: Cannot check in online, but via the app on a smartphone, no problem (except I wanted a printed boarding pass). Call centre staff in India wanted to speak to my 5 year old daughter when my family accompanied me one one trip, as she was on a different booking and wouldn't give me her flight reference number \"for security reasons\". No problem with \"security reasons\" when I paid BA a lot of money for the ticket. Upgrading with points or Avios fails in the middle of a transaction. The system remains unavailable to check you in for some time after, so you have to call the call centre. BA blacks out so many flights from purchasing with Avios, it's not worth trying unless you're jobless and can fly any time, and don't care where you go. In the queue for boarding my passport wasn't open at the right page and the staff at the gate admonished me as a result. On another occasion at passport control after checking in I was directed back to the BA desk I'd just come from. \"There's nothing wrong with your passport, it must be BAA. It's not us\", was the response. It took a huffing, tutting, BA duty manager to run the visa check again. I advise people to avoid BA if possible. The only reason for choosing BA is flight safety. But other airlines manage that too, with a smile. So, no excuse.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London Gatwick to Salzburg. Agent at baggage drop was rude and off hand, she tried to take my well under maximum sized cabin bag for \"free\" check-in as hold luggage. Even when I explained that it contained valuable items and medication, she still persisted. Boarding was efficiently managed, a pleasant change from the free for all I experienced on my last BA flight. The cabin crew made no attempt to greet passengers, or help with stowing luggage. The snack included in the ticket price consisted of a \"muesli\" which resembled yoghurt with a few oats stirred in, a stale, a unbuttered bread roll containing a slice of plastic cheese and a very small plastic cup of tea. Service was lacking in finesse. The one plus was landing twenty minutes early.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Orlando on 27th November. Take the same flight every year, and in previous years everything has been great apart from the food. This year they have upped their game with the food service and standard. In the past, there has been a huge noticeable difference between club world from Gatwick and Heathrow, now very little difference.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Having previously flown with British Airways on their European routes, I thought I would take a long haul flight with them. I arrived 2 hours before departure at Heathrow Terminal 3 and couldn't quite understand what was going on; the queue to actually drop my pre-checked luggage was long, very long, hearing customers complaining they were standing in line for a good hour, and that there were no signs of BA taking any steps to remedy the situation. Even with my frantic tweeting at BA, nothing improved. The situation boiled down to the fact that only 4 desks were open for the general public on the day that schools finished. Needless to say, whoever was in charge that day didn't really know what they were doing and caused a lot of agro for many customers, and BA needs to take full responsibility of this. Once these proceedings had passed, I found myself boarding the Boeing 747-400 which was tired and not very well maintained. Leg room was atrociously tight, with a metal support for the seat in front of me limiting the actual usable legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good selection of films, but was made to be disappointing with the meagre 7\" to 9\" screens. The staff was very friendly. Looking after our area was a charming staff who really made us feel welcome and did his very best to find some people seconds if they were left hungry after the meal. The meal was decent, not fantastic.  My only note when it comes to food and drink is that more water should be made available. I found myself constantly thirsty and having to go back to the galley to ask for water. All in all, I wouldn't fly with BA again using their long-haul services unless I were to fly in Business or First. The ground service is terrible. I am left disappointed given how decent their short-haul flights are, and how much they pride themselves on the quality of their products in that market.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Singapore to London Heathrow with British Airways in Premium Economy, and abysmal priority boarding. No pre take off drinks. Ran out of wine bottle drinks and also ran out of meal choices. Seat was truly dreadful. I had to climb over the armrest to get out. The person behind played games by stabbing at the screen for 14 hours. Complaints Department don't care and I am still waiting for my miles to be credited.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Cape Town to Geneva via London return. I was disappointed in my long haul flight with British Airways. they squash you in like sardines on a long haul and offer uncomfortable seats and tiny, rather blurred screens for movie watching. Our flight from Geneva was delayed for 40 min whilst they \"looked for someones lost baggage \" making us very stressed about catching our flight home on time. The service and food was ok ,but the fact that they lost my luggage on my return flight from Geneva to Cape Town was really hugely inconvenient. I expected much more from British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Calgary with British Airways. Would not let me use avios points to upgrade even though I had plenty. They only allocate 10% of cabin occupancy for this - shockingly poor. You don't expect your national airline to scupper your honeymoon plans. Although there was plenty of availability in the cabin, the fact that only 10% is allocated (and potentially seats can go empty) they wont let you upgrade. We paid for tickets regardless in the cabin below, but still not allowed to upgrade. I would have used another airline if I knew in advance (and will do in future).: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Singapore with British Airways, and the plane left 90 minutes late due to technical fault with one of their aging 747-400 that found itself minus two wheels stuck on the runway. First class was full. One would think BA would put themselves out on this route given the competition from Singapore Airlines. Wrong - the champagne was lukewarm (as is often the case). The amuse bouche taster was ghastly. Some sort of couscous and tasteless. Appetiser of sushi style salmon was very nice. Soup nice but lukewarm. Salad was forgotten by the miserable female FA. Mains of sea bass was very good. My wife had the same - but the beef main. She was very complimentary of the meal. White wine was luke warm. Solution - the miserable FA came back with a paper cup of ice cubes and dumped the lot in my glass. Brilliant. Wash bag of freebies was cheap and tacky. The seat - well I am very critical of this design. So much space is wasted with the \"island\" console in the middle. The designer of this seat should find another career. Seats already starting to show wear and tear. Why British Airways opted for a canvas material rather than leather is a mystery. In summary, the A380 is fabulous. Slept for about 5 hours. Great flight. FAs mostly were fine. Terrific landing by a very skilled pilot. All in all - it was okay - but not overwhelming as First Class should be.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "The British Airways outbound flight from London to Hong Kong was on a 3 year old A380. We sat near the back on the upper deck and were very pleased with how comfortable and smooth it was. On the upper deck there is a cupboard by the window seat which gives more space to put your coats and also doubles up as a shelf to put your drinks. The 5 year old Boeing 777 on the return leg was far more cramped. Also the video screen was faulty and it was difficult to click on the screen. The crew on all flights were fine but nothing special. Just performed their job but never really seemed to go out of their way.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Arrived slightly stressed as flight from Oslo delayed nearly 2 hours due to engine problem. Crew were caring and assured us that bags were on board. Food excellent and wine great. CSD informed us that a snow storm was on the way and we might be stuck in NYC as their flight the next night had already been cancelled. Newark was deserted and bags were there in 5 minutes. Overall superb flight with British Airways from London to Newark.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London City to New York JFK return. This is a totally different experience. There is no conventional lounge, but there is a 'pop up' with copious champagne but little food. Boarding and take off lasts all of 10 minutes so no time for more champagne. The crew then come around with canapés before the refuelling stop in Ireland. In the morning you clear US customs here, in the evening it is just a bore. The seats are wide and fully flat but very little privacy between each of a pair. IFE is on tablets which are a bit limited in choice and have no moving map. The food was not even usual BA standard and was lukewarm. With 3 crew for only 38 passengers, service was excellent. All in all, difficult to recommend over standard BA service unless it is a very good price or getting to London City is easy.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was originally booked on a United Airlines flight from London to Boston, connecting through Washington Dulles, but this was cancelled because of the snow in DC. United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the flight to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one of the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay £65 to bring the bag. When I complained said \"it's not my problem\". I asked if they could call United to clarify the bag issue, but they refused, saying \"we don't even talk to United\" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem. The maximum volume was also too low so it was difficult to hear the movies over the cabin noise, and I am not hard of hearing. It was disappointing that there was no onboard WiFi or personal device entertainment. British Airways seriously threw away an opportunity to convince me to fly with them in the future.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Vancouver to Dar-es-salaam via London / Doha. Yet another dreadful experience with British Airways! Why do I travel with them? This time, BA advised me that my return itinerary was changed because of a cancellation by their codeshare partner Qatar Airways to the Dar-es-Salaam leg of the journey, which would give me a 24 hour layover in Doha before connecting onward to London. In itself, that was not an issue, but BA did everything possible to wash their hands of any responsibilities for their obligations under EC Regulation No 261/2004 as required by Article 14.2 - which they even post on their website!!. It took a day of calls by my travel agent, and 2 hours of debating with an agent, his supervisor, and the office in Manchester before they agreed that it was their responsibility. Their solution : a rerouting of my journey through Nairobi with an extra flight by a non-code share partner that cost them more than the cost an overnight hotel in Doha - something they refused to consider. Go figure! Never again with British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Have been impressed with British Airways in the past, today we had a very different experience on our flight from Edinburgh to London Gatwick. We checked in online and arrived to drop off our bags 45 minutes before the departure time and were met by an extremely moody check in lady. She radioed another member of staff to ask if we were to be allowed to come on the flight in an extremely moody manner, trying to have us not admitted (even though 45 minutes is the amount of time to arrive before from their website). Eventually we were allowed and with one last scowl from the staff left the desk. We got through security rushing as we thought we must be really late only to find the plane delayed for an hour.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outbound British Airways flight from London to Rio de Janeiro demonstrated the difference a decent crew can make to a flight. The staff in Club World were all male and mature, and delivered an excellent service. British Airways seating arrangement in Club World is looking increasingly outdated, but a less than half full cabin meant that one was less bothered by one's neighbours. Food was reasonable, although it was surprising how quickly menu options ran out. IFE had a good selection of films, but the resolution of the screens is poor. No queues at border control and priority baggage handling meant that we were in our taxi within 20 minutes of leaving the plane.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Male, and just when we thought the British Airways business class offer could get no worse, we checked in to find that the BA lounge was shut and the alternative was the number 1 Traveller lounge where for both first and business class, champagne has to be purchased. Needless to say, no advance notice of this was give,n and by the admission of their own staff  British Airways management just don't care what impact this will have on customers who have paid a great deal of money to fly premium class. Based on our recent flights with BA where we have witnessed penny pinching devaluation of the business class experience, to the extent that there is now no comparison with other similarly priced airlines. Their cavalier approach to customer care may result in others like us saying last time with BA ever!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Bangkok to London Heathrow, and BA is really slipping down the quality standards. With these tired old Boeing 777's, business class is pretty poor.

Thin contents for the amenity bag and tired seating really shows up against the competition.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from London Heathrow to Jeddah, took off over one hour late due to an unspecified technical issue. Economy section full. Seats generally okay, 7 inch screen provides a small selection of videos and music on demand. Food was some kind of chicken curry with a salted chocolate caramel mousse plus a roll and cheese. Close to arrival they offered a cheese croissant plus additional drinks. Alcohol available for free until around Egypt. One serious cleaning issue under seat 34c where the side of the computer box looked like it had never been cleaned hence food detritus had built up. Pleasant crew, just one extended message which was non safety related which could have been omitted.: 1 occurrences\n",

British Airways standards are slipping!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to New York JFK with British Airways, and abyssal customer service. Onboard the flight can be great, and it's the website and shoddy call centre staff who let them down. However, this time the onboard service was as bad as the ground service. Food was poor. I was in the upper deck with only 5 other business class passengers, and yet my food choice was gone. The TV's didn't work in 2 seats - I couldn't be bothered to try a third and decided to just get some sleep. The staff insisted on forming a cliquish huddle and were speaking so loudly I couldn't even sleep with ear plugs in.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Houston from London Heathrow in premium economy. The seats could recline a lot and were quite large. However the TV screens were beyond small. It looked like ones from 2002 were better. There was virtually no difference in food to economy (except you had more than two choices), and champagne was served before and after takeoff in glasses. But after 10 hours the seat becomes very uncomfortable as you cannot lift the armrests away, because the tray table and remote are stationed in there. This made sleeping hard. Don't fly premium economy British Airways, it's disappointing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I flew British Airways from Bucharest to London Heathrow return, with A320 and A321 on return. The service was good, meals okay, good staff. The return flight was 100% full and we were forced to check in hand luggage, which was rather strange. The flight from London Heathrow was not on time. It had a 30 minutes delay. Overall, the best experience for the amount of money required on Bucharest-London route.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Avios points flight to London from Toronto for Christmas in Business class. Slow queue for check in though given flying just Christmas there were a lot of people and luggage to be fair. The BA club lounge at Pearson remains well run and clean. Too few toilets and a really unimaginative wine selection being the only issues. Onboard, the usual slow service taking coats (I had to ask), papers, drink, menu amenity kit - very random and fragmented delivery by an assortment of crew. The meal service was fast with drinks served first. The evening meal was average at best and overcooked, with the tray delivered with the starter and dessert already on it with the hot entrée dumped on the tray and that was it. Had to ask for cheese and a second coffee. Across the piece, you can see the cuts and money saving British Airways are making to business class. Even now - the two posh chocolates have been replaced by a unwrapped chocolate finger, no flower in the toilets, no drinks offered after dinner. The list goes on! Breakfast was nothing special with an egg and bacon muffin which is at least edible (unlike the previous bacon baguette.) Reasonable entertainment choices. Crew were the usual indifferent long haul \"I'm here as a favour to you all\" with little rapport or effort in delivering a world class service! I think the main problem British Airways have is a dated cabin product. The ying yang seating in it's day was innovative and one of the first lay flat beds. Now, crawling over a stranger to reach the isle, being bumped by people and carts if you're on the aisle, and a lack of storage space mean that the BA product is way inferior to Air Canada and a lot of the middle eastern carriers. My loyalty is now being tested and with the constant devaluing of the Executive Club benefits including mileage flight availability and cost I am now questioning my loyalty to British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Mexico City return flights on British Airways for me and my partner using Avios and an Amex companion voucher.

      "Las Vegas to London with British Airways was awful. We were in first class, travelling with 2 young children and wanted to put them to bed on this long flight, and we had booked a row of 4 seats so we could sleep one child one adult. We check in at first class which was delayed, as they are busy and have moved some economy passengers to the first class line to speed up things. Then we are told one of our seats has been moved, the staff are unsure as to why and will rectify this immediately and bring my boarding pass to the lounge. An hour later I go to the check in desk as nobody from BA has been bothered to come - I am then told, actually your seat is broken nothing we can do, and its now my problem. This seat is in the middle, therefore it means either one child alone on the otherside of the cabin or the 2 children together behind me and my husband alone the other side of the cabin. No other options and British Airways are not prepared to ask anyone to swap seats so we can sit 2 together on different rows. We kept the children together behind me, obviously meaning I could not sleep the whole flight and my husband was alone. Then the lamp on my childs seat malfunctioned and was on full beam the whole night flight keeping one of them awake - the attendents were unable to override the light - seriously. They did offer to seat my child at the front of the cabin in a different seat, alone surrounded by strangers or to move me to the front which would have left my children completely alone. On out outward flight from London to Vegas one of our seats also malfunctioned and the tv etc went down for the entire journey - nothing the cabin staff could do then either. Apparently they are old planes! We are still waiting for a response from British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Munich to New York JFK via London in Club Europe and Premium Economy. After flying up front on long haul trips for the last 15 years I plucked up the courage to give British Airways World Traveller Plus a try. First Galleries lounge at LHR was good and had my fill from the very good food and drinks. Upon boarding I was disappointed to find that the cabin was yet to be retrofitted with the new (allegedly) much better product. Despite its age the seat was comfortable but the only good feature is the foot rest which is quite adaptable and helps when trying to get some sleep. IFE has improved in the last 12 months with about 10 current films, although the screen is dated both in respect of size and resolution. As a Gold Card holder I expected a bit more personalized service, there was no recognition of my status at all. Crew were experienced and delivered a good service despite a full cabin. Food (Tandoori Chicken or Beef Cheeks) was excellent and virtually a Club World meal - in fact it was better than previous Club World meals I've had on recent trips. All in all good value for money when not paying full fare, and given that Club World is so mediocre, Premium Economy is adequate for flights 7 hours or under.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This was and will remain the first and last time I will fly British Airways. Having flown this route numerous times before with a popular UK based airline I thought I would try BA. I expected a comparable experience at least, whilst hoping for something a cut above. On the outbound flight we were offered orange or champagne, the return flight was orange juice or water but only half the cabin was served so we didn't get anything. Outbound menu did not correspond with the food on offer and the choice of meal soon became no choice at all as halfway through serving the cabin section of 32 seats they ran out. At least on the return flight they managed two thirds of the cabin section before the options dried up again. There was a number of very disgruntled passengers who wondered what exactly they paid extra for. A minor gripe was the toilet was right through the economy section which I'm sure got on those passengers nerves. Seats were ok but the quality of the media system was poor and the touch screen was unreliable and a number of them didn't work at all so more upset passengers. I gave up on mine and watched movies on my phone, the quality was far superior. I had heard good things about BA however that was flying business/club or first class. Maybe that's what they concentrate on.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways flight from Punta Cana to London. The food was awful and the cabin crew gave the impression that they were doing us a favour when going about their duties.

We upgraded to premium economy on the way back expecting better leg room but I hardly noticed a difference! The plane looks old and the food was shocking! They advertise that there are great chefs picking the meals but the breakfast consisted of what I presume was a sausage and some type of scrambled egg, it was not nice. The flight did not take off for an hour because the entertainment system was faulty. The entertainment was ok, however the music could do with updating. The staff were friendly and it was easy checking in.: 1 occurrences\n",

Sadly British Airways seems to have it's most rude and arrogant staff on flights to India, who treat passengers poorly and don't really care. Flew MAN-LHR-BOS return last month and the staff on those flights seemed to be much better. Same with the food - food on the flight to and from India wasn't great - I asked for a specific meal on the outward journey which wasn't there and was instead there on the return leg - which I did not need. When I queried this - the answer was \"You must have made a mistake\" and the attitude was of a \"take it or leave it\".: 1 occurrences\n",

I was travelling with my partner and we were not initially seated together. Seating together was only confirmed at the time of boarding. It is unacceptable to have to pay for a seat. Food selection and quality was poor. Chicken Tikka dry, and the appearance a murky brown colour except the rice. Meal was starchy with both rice and potatoes. Overall cheap! They had run out of our choice for the next meal by the time they reached us. Again the selection very limited. Meal very cheap and unappetising and left almost uneaten. Offered only one drink (tea, coffee, water) with no refill offered. Staff service very mediocre at best. I could not charge my computer on either the outbound or return flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I travel quite often to Europe and elsewhere but have avoided flying British Airways due to bad experiences in the past. However I decided to try the airline again - and a big mistake! Checked in online and selected a widow seat near the front of the aircraft. On arriving at LGW I was informed my seat had been unilaterally changed to an aisle seat at the rear of the aircraft! I am absolutely disgusted by such treatment. No other airline has done that to me ever in 20 years of flying. As a result of this I shall now try even harder to avoid flying British Airways whenever possible. Oh and the flight was delayed and the boarding staff were slow and inefficient. Bad experience all round.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "I have used British Airways on a regular basis between Rome and Gatwick. My flights have usually been on time, most aircraft do not have the new interior, a few with bmi screens at the door. I always order AVML meals which are good quality for dinner, but plain cheese, cucumber and tomoato sandwiches for afternoon tea. My issue is the inconsistency with the cabin crew who can vary from pleasant to rude and cut corners with the service when they can. I appreciate that the LGW base is a \"low cost\" base for BA, but there is no excuse for the crew to behave as they do. easyJet and Vueling crew look more professional and are more pleasant on the same route. The LGW lounge is tired and average at best. It needs a good clean. FCO still has no lounge after the fire in the summer nor have any other arrangements been made. Flying in and out of LGW with BA you are aware that this is not the real BA and is downgraded in all ways from LHR.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Checked in and found the Club lounge was \"landside\" meaning one had to allow time to get through security after using it. I need not have worried as I spent all of 60 seconds in the shared lounge that British Airways use with about eight airlines. As BA have 3 daily flights to Hannover and potentially 60+ users of the facility, I could have been forgiven to thinking there might be some decent food around. Wrong! The meal was a bunch of dried up sausages in a steamer that looked like samples in a medical lab. Ghastly. A few bits of cheese here and there and that was it. I quickly moved on and had an excellent dinner in the Movenpick restaurant a few meters away.  Only three passenger in Club and the plane pushed back 5 minutes early. The meal I was offered was a reasonable looking prawn salad. I declined as I was well fed. A couple of Gin and Tonics and the flight of 90 minutes passed easily. FAs very friendly. Landing was in high winds and very well executed. Was the return trip worth it for £800? Not really but then my client paid the bill.: 1 occurrences\n",

Was seated in 1A so leg room was fine. Anywhere else in Club Europe is a waste of time and little space. Plane took off 40 minutes late. FAs were fine. Declined the miserable, pathetic looking dried up sandwich which was the inflight meal. Had a couple of Gin and Tonics instead. Comfortable flight of about 80 minutes.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "This review covers my usual return trip from London Heathrow to Dubai. Both flights are overnight and I use points to upgrade to business. It was a Boeing 777 going out and Boeing 747 on the return trip. There was nothing really wrong with either flight but I only really use them for the timings and the flat bed to get some sleep. I don't like the weird front to back 2x4x2 layout and cannot forsee how much longer British Airways can get away with this as it is so out of date with modern standards. It is fine if you get a window seat and no one attached to you. Having watched the seating pattern filling up over several months I eventually paid £136 extra to reserve a window seat both ways. After a couple of hours the bed is very hard and the storage is almost non existent. That said, the crew were polite and served well. They seemed to be older and I think that makes the difference, they understand customer service. On the return, one cabin crew in particular was very responsive and helpful in offering tea mid flight. Overall the product is outdated and this time the service was good. It got me there and back safely and I was fed and watered. I am very open to moving my custom elsewhere though, primarily due to the seat layout.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check in both ways was excellent and priority security. British Airways lounge at Heathrow and Spa very nice as was breakfast served there. Lounge at Houston is far too small, so many 'status' holders in there that it became standing room only. Outbound plane we were due to fly on went 'tech' 45 mins before departure so swapped and after delay of 2 hours they got a 'new' plane. Sadly neither plane nor interior were new. The 'new first' First class seats ageing badly, grubby and scuffed, seat electrics hesitant to work at times and old entertainment system that failed during the flight. Interior much better on the way back. Crew excellent and attentive on way out. Food well presented but poor outbound, better coming back, wine same both ways and rather average. Surprised the hand baggage allowance is same in all classes now, In First class you have an entire overhead to yourself and seat storage, so why not allow First passengers to make use of it?. Priority baggage labelling as always pointless - came out in the middle of everyone elses. The simple question to ask is was it worth it - if I had paid for it, a no. Not a big enough upgrade on business class to justify the difference and not a First Class experience in some important aspects.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I regularly travel British Airways to LCY and LHR and found them to be nothing more than a glorified Ryanair in terms of service. I also flew a longer sector (Kiev to London) last week and it was awful. On the A319 they only have 1 toilet at the rear of the plane for all economy passenger. On a 4 hour flight this resulted in massive queues discomforting passenger on the last 4-5 rows as well as long waits for those actually using the loo. The food was horrendous (Chicken Kiev!) and the air hostesses were surly, abrupt and really uninterested and unfriendly. I don't want them to do the fake smile and friendliness thing, but these girls and guys were genuinely unhappy and unfriendly. As for my regular weekly or biweekly flights between Dublin and LCY or LHR, the E170 service to LCY is ok, it's punctual, and you get a stale croissant for breakfast on it. What really annoys me is how British Airways treats its frequent flyers, makes it impossible to get any meaningful benefit from BA despite having travelled numerous times with them (every other week at least!) and paid hundreds of pounds in fares that are usually well above the competition. They also have this \"seat selection\" fee for their bronze members if they book a hand luggage only fare. They cite that these fares are there to make it competitive but they really are not anywhere near competitive on routes they sell from Dublin and the treatment of regular flyers and bronze members leaves a lot to be desired (it's basically meaningless: I would have far better service on Cityjet or Aer Lingus which both server those routes, for a lower fare, while being able to choose my seat for free at check-in time). As a result, I am seriously considering my use of British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I decided to fly British Airways as it is now the only oneworld carrier with Premium Economy between Sydney and Singapore, since Qantas now only runs A330s with Business and basic economy into Singapore. It was a pleasant surprise with very good service and food and a pleasant ambience onboard. Almost all passengers were flying onto London and this also applied to the return run from Singapore, with almost all passengers originating in London. This means that for the return flight from Singapore most other people had slept all the way from London and were chatting and moving about the cabin, meaning it was almost impossible to get any sleep on the relatively short overnight flight between Singapore to Sydney. So, if you don't mind skipping any sleep between Singapore and Sydney this is a nice alternative when planning to fly from Australia to Singapore and return. Many passengers had their window blinds shut during the landing approaches into Singapore and also Sydney when I understood just the opposite was supposed to be the case for safety reasons. Not sure why BA allows this to happen.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from LHR to SEA. Very good check-in at LHR T5 and fortunate with efficient security checks. On board, very full flight and hadn't paid extra to book seat early so suffered with seat A by the window. Old fit-out 747, small screens very poor for watching what was a decent selection on IFE. Paid extra for enhanced meal service which was a big plus. Could be improved by offering better quality wine as meal is B-class standard. Definitely worth the extra (in the context of onboard catering).: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways back from Bangkok to London Heathrow at the end of our holiday and I was not much looking forward to Club World on a 777 having started the holiday with a flight in First in an A380 (absolutely wonderful). I was very pleasantly surprised. Checkin involved no queueing and the same through priority security. Had access to the Cathay lounge and this was good. The pleasant surprise was the Club cabin. I have got used to the rather warn and used state of the Club World cabin in BA’s 777 and 747. This one appeared very clean and smart. The seats we find comfortable and enjoy the ying yang seating for couples travelling together. We found food to be very good for the two meals we were served. The final comment is that the staff appeared to be friendlier and more enthusiastic about their jobs. We found the staff on the flight home in Club were friendly and attentive. Overall,  a very enjoyable flight. The IFE was the old product but it works and managed to sit though 4 films to pass the time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways TXL-LHR-TXL in Business Class. Aircraft looked new, bright and clean. Seats in Club Europe are comfortable. IFE is not available, except for viewing the route displayed on LCD maps. Cabin crew were attentive and quick in offering drinks and meals. On the flight back, I really a tasty prawn salad served with white wine or champagne. Perfect punctuality and smooth boarding. I would definitely fly again and recommend them.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I have flown British Airways Business Class and was pleased with Lounge, food service, Elemis Spa, showers wit Elemis products and on request champagne. Onboard with comfortable fully reclining seats, duvet and amenities appropriately dispersed per sex. Staff friendly and accommodating, cabin (upper deck- A380) clean and comfortable. My next trip in August was last minute with just First available. I felt very comfortable booking this since my experience in business has always been very nice. My past experiences with First prior to renovated cabins, separate seating cells- I felt it was still going to be a lovely, comfortable experience, with enjoyable food. So, with all the changes in First now, I thought I would really be in for a relaxing treat. I want to preface this by saying I have always loved British Airways and has always been my first choice for London- Houston, JFK-London flights for years. I had a early flight. Checked in in ample time before my flight. I went straight to the Concorde Room to have breakfast. What I was met with was basically a cafeteria style, self serve service. There was no table service, two people working behind the food counter. I met an English couple while waiting in-line to put in a simple scramble eggs on toast order as they and we were both told that the toaster was in front of us, and we needed to toast on own bread. It all went downhill from there. The wait was long, traveling on your own you had to keep an eye on your table to make sure it was not taken, tables were left unserviced and unclean. I carried some dishes to the front just so I could be seated. Boarded plane, seated, and started looking around and the carpet was dirty. It looked as it had not been vacuumed from the last flight, which did not give me a clean and comfortable feeling. The the steward came to me and said they ran out of women's toiletry kits because they do not allot according to reservation, but normally catering to men traveling on business and not women traveling on pleasure. He offered a Men's toiletry kit and a Business Class kit. The food was served. I started with their appetizers which was all dry and very unappetizing (and I am not picky), but for me to find it unappealing it has to be poor. Then the entrees were short and I had to choose a second choice. Any one of these events would be okay- even though they advertised that all is superb, but everything, constantly occurring had me regretting I paid for First and have sworn, for the price differential vs service and quality,  Business Class wins out hands down. The food was far from septacular or tasty - it felt overcooked and choices limited and short. The Pilot did come out and asked if BA could call me and he was very apologetic (I guess a Steward/ess mentioned the faux pas's  - I consented. Disappointment ran consistent from beginning to end - no call, no email, no apology - in my opinion that is the epitome of service from beginning to end. It left me feeling that BA really did not care about any of it - the service in lounges, the appropriate allocation of food, kits, cleanliness- all of it. My flight back to JFK I flew Business. It was comfortable. Though there was less space in First class seats years ago, but the service was brilliant and comfortable and the food was delicious. I am sad my experience this time could not compare to years gone by - even if it was more simplistic. My review is for First only.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices. I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure flight, all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which the crew apologised sincerely, but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly. The entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films, though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full. We were kept well informed of the flight progress throughout by a cheery and personable First Officer, who navigated a mean-looking thunderstorm near landing with aplomb. All in all this was a relaxing and luxurious way to begin our holiday and a great to example of BA at their best.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "LGW to TPA with British Airways. Boeing 777-200 was an older aircraft but clean, very friendly crew, all smiles and helpful. Food was ok, three different choices, though sadly ran out of red wine mid flight. Seat ok for economy apart from the woman in front of me who must have thought she was in Club and kept trying to recline her seat into a flat bed.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very disappointed with British Airways. Very little leg room, I'm only 5ft 7in but I had to sit sideways for the flight. Food very basic, only a roll on both the outward and the return flight at 5.30pm. Other airlines offer a snack. Wouldn't travel British Airways again, budget airlines have more leg room.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Glasgow to Bangkok via Heathrow with British Airways. We never received \"paid for seats\" that we have just had £160.00 refunded back on to my credit card after complaining that we never on both legs of our flights. We had been told that we would not get refund as we had assistance? I e-mail them and informed I had my e-mail confirmation of set numbers and payment and seat ticket subs to prove my claim and at no point did I ask for or need or receive any assistance. They back tracked and I was informed my claim was authorised and it would take 6/8 weeks. British Airways need to stop this practice as it does not show the Airline in a good light. I would be wary of using British Airways long haul again, the aircraft are too old and shabby, and the female stewardess need to go back on a training course on customer service. Spirit of service what happened to that.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I think one word sums it up 'Rubbish'. The London to Barbados flight was passable, however the return journey was a joke. It started at Grantley Adams airport where passengers were bumped off the flight through overbooking, we fortunately, were there early enough to be able to get onto the flight. We sat down and found that the seat in front of me was broken, so I had to spend the eight hour flight with the seat in my face, the gentleman in front was very apologetic however it was not his fault. There were no headsets and only two cots on board, in spite of numerous babies needing this facility, leading to very fractious and tired little ones, a nightmare for parents I would presume. Next the food, abysmal! A choice of peri peri chicken or pasta with tomato and cheese, no cheese and a thick horrible overpowering spicy tomato sauce, revolting. The tea and coffee was served at the same time as the food so if you wanted to eat and have wine, by the time you got to your tea or coffee it was cold - (obviously cabin crew in a hurry to clear). Breakfast was an all time low, a cold congealed croissant with a little butter and jam plus what can only be described as a bird seed bar. I have travelled with British Airways for more than 40 years and have never had food like this on a long haul flight, or in face any flight. Many years ago when I used to travel from Singapore and Malaysia with British Airways the food was excellent, even in economy, menu, three choices of main meals and cooked breakfast that was always very good. The cabin crew could not care less and somehow fail to realise that we, the customer, actually pay their wages. I asked for milk for my tea instead of the creamer for coffee that was provided albeit in miniscule amounts and was told by cabin crew that the creamer was ok. I did not feel like a paying customer at all, just a nuisance. British Airways have lost the plot and are up against great airlines such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines, although sadly not on the Barbados route.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I flew British Airways from Heathrow to Istanbul, Business Class (supposedly!), on an A320. We found our seats to be both hard and uncomfortable with minimal legroom and the hot meal provided, breakfast in our case, was dire. The toilet at the front of the aircraft was so unbelievably small as to be difficult to use. We consider that the conditions we had to put up with were quite unsuitable for a four hour flight. I am puzzled why British Airways would choose to offer such a miserable Business Class experience, it would be more honest and cause less disappointment if they were to declare all their European A320 flights to be economy only.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My husband and I flew to Vancouver with British Airways on 2nd December 2015. We were due to return to UK on 9th December in Premium Economy. Unfortunately our flight was cancelled due to engine failure. British Airways were unable to get us onto a flight on the following day, Thursday, and so we were booked to return on the Friday, 48 hours after we were due to return home. Despite the inevitable disappointment and inconvenience as we were due to return to a busy work schedule on the Friday, British Airways were excellent. They couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating, putting us up in a lovely hotel for two nights, providing food vouchers and then upgrading us to business class when we were eventually returned home. The ground and flight staff at Vancouver were fantastic, understanding and went the extra mile without exception.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew GRU-LHR on the upper deck in seats 63AB in business class. We were able to use the new TAM lounge at terminal 3 GRU, this was an amazing lounge, huge, lots of food and drink on offer, showers, sleeping area, lots of seating. I was apprehensive about the seating plan on BA with the reverse seat by the window and the aisle facing forward. Travelling as a couple, this seating actually works really well, it's good to be able to chat with each other throughout the flight and is much better than the Herringbone seating - that being said if you are travelling alone I can understand why it may not be preferable. Offered champagne on boarding, before dinner further drinks service. The food was excellent which included dinner and breakfast prior to arrival. The seat was very comfortable, full flat bed, the only problem I found was being 6ft 1in, my feet touched the wall at the end and I couldn't fully stretch out but this did not prevent me sleeping. Upon arrival at Heathrow, the luggage was coming around the carousel by the time I got there, which was only about 10-15 mins after disembarkation. My only complaint I could find was the Entertainement was slightly limited, and there was no USB to charge my phone, but this is an older aircraft.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Prague to New York via London. A really good experience for the price. Comfortable seats and a good inflight entertainment. Not that good food though.

      "MAD-SYD VIA LHR with British Airways. Overall good experience. All flights on time. Transfer in LHR T5 very fast and easy. For the long-haul flights: comfortable seats, personal IFE, lots of choices availeable. Food was decent for economy. The only downside: Flight attendants failed to give a good service on all 4 sectors. Not one staff member gave a service with a smile.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Third time flying the British Airways A380 and the only reason that we did is because it was a BA Amex 2for1 redemption. However to ensure that we maxed out the experience, as always we pre booked seats. On checking in online seats had been moved, contacted BA Bronze and reply was \"cannot answer why, possibly operational reasons, more information should be available at check in\". Check in, no response. On board our seats were occupied by what appeared to be \"normal\" passengers, i.e. no entourage. Seats we were allocated, lumbar and head rest functions did not operate, cabin crew tried rebooting but no luck, so onwards and upwards. Having flown BA a reasonable amount I have come to the conclusion that the cabin crew, despite operating with poorly designed cabins, poorly maintained (seats) equipment (we had a similar scenario on a Heathrow to LA and return last July where we had the same reg plane, same seats and similar problem which was not fixed after the flight out) manage to maintain a brave company face. BA Club Lounge: Again, food choice poor, running out, although granted peak hours, but if other airlines can cope why cannot BA? Cabin crew: Service very good and friendly. Food reasonable, but nothing that makes you say that \"that was good\". Entertainment: Poor, old \"ish\" and second rate movies, enough said. Seats: Unfortunately in this case we leave the worst till last. Having flown Qantas, Emirates and Qatar A380's like everybody else we wonder why BA did not take the opportunity for a redesign of layout and seat area. Well we know why = £££'s, Question? Does no one on the BA cabin design team wear glasses? There is no storage space, if it goes in the drawer with the shoes, you have to move the seat from sleep position to access, so you are left with the possibility of either wearing and damaging said specs, or hanging them over the separator. Again, competitors manage it. The seat itself, is harder than the competitors above (mattress?) and apparently I discovered that extra pillows are no longer carried, so you have one and thats it. Unfortunately, we do still have to use BA next March, but have booked Qatar again for October. Additionally, the Customer Service service in India is sadly woefully short in all areas, although polite working from scripts and unable to solve / answer simple questions. Frustration. A question for BA: We really want to support and be proud of our national flag carrier but what are the incentives for using BA? I do not mean cost.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from LGW-BCN on the A320 seated in seats 2D/2F. Lounge at Gatwick prior to boarding was very nice, offered good food and drink selection including champagne on request. Cabin crew friendly and attentive. I was a bit apprehensive about BA's new business class product but the seat was comfortable and having the middle seat free does allow for more room, although the leg room is a little tight, but okay for a short flight. We were served a cold meal which was quite tasty along with complimentary drinks. I would recommend British Airways.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Salzburg to London Gatwick. Check in was very slow. Boarding at Salzburg involves a bus ride out to the plane. No attempt was made to separate passengers by row numbers onto the two buses used, as other airlines do in a similar situation, resulting in an absolutely chaotic boarding process. Cabin crew were off hand. The in flight snack was thrown at rather served to passengers. The totally inedible \"sandwiches\" offered consisted of rubbery processed cheese between two thick slices of poor quality bread. The one consolation was that the flight lasted just less than two hours.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I flew from Heathrow to Amsterdam in business class on a free Avios upgrade with British Airways. We made use of the galleries south lounge in terminal 5, which had a good variety of drinks and snacks. Full meal on the 45 minute flight The service was very good, but I would not pay the asking price for such a short trip. Great when its almost free.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Recently flew to LA on British Airways and was thoroughly underwhelmed with the experience on the BA A380. I travel regularly in business class on Emirates, normally on the same equipment. The BA configuration upstairs is quite cramped and far inferior to other Airlines, even to the extent of having to stretch over other passengers to leave your seat. In addition the staff seem preoccupied with their own arrangements and although were fine with me, were mildly irritated with the requests of other passengers, openly commenting to each other in front of me. The cleanliness of the plane also left a lot to be desired, after only a couple of hours into the flight, the toilets were disgusting with the floor awash - I don't think crew check them on a regular basis. The window seat has side stowage facilities, which in my case had a disgusting pale yellow fluid and rubbish in it. When mentioned to crew, they did get some paper towels to dry it out, but needless to say I didn't use it (photo attached). Overall poor value for money.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Rio de Janeiro to London Heathrow. Several weeks after booking our flights on-line, for reasons unknown BA moved us from the flight we had booked and put us on to the previous day's flight. I had to phone them (it took 20 minutes to get through) and re-book us on to the flight we had booked in the first place. The customer service department is totally useless. I have sent several e-mails asking why they did what they did, and all I get is meaningless 'off-the-shelf' standard replies. I have asked three times for the name. position and address of someone I can write to about this but they consistently fail to give me this information. I presume the tactic is to make me so fed up that I'll just give up and go away. A second-rate airline which is definitely to be avoided.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Krakow, good flights with efficient, friendly crews, although the seating is so cramped these days - not a business class experience any more. Reasonable food and plenty of drinks. No lounge in Krakow and nothing like enough seats at gate made it a poor airport experience there. Just about okay overall.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We boarded and arrived to destination late (30 minutes) but inflight experience was nearly flawless. Cabin seemed to have some mood lighting, comfortable leather seats with headrest, and enough legroom. Crew pleasant and hardworking, they spoke to passengers with onward connections about the state of their flight. Vegetarian salad was welcome, as was the small bottle of wine.  It certainly wasn't the cheapest flight but I noticed the difference.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "I was very pleased with my flight on this aircraft, it was my first time flying on a B747, and it made quite the impression. This flight was full with a duration of approx 9 hours. Rough start as we had to wait an extra 45 min for additional crew for the flight. Each seat equipped with a blanket and pillow, e individual TV screens with a broad range of movies/tv shows. I am 6ft and found the leg room to be adequate (my knees did start to become sore towards the end), but enough room. Crew were great and food service the best I've received. A couple rounds of snack/drink service and a hot meal served which was great. It seemed very easy for everyone around to sleep but I can never sleep on planes so I stayed awake.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Outward leg in Premium Economy on British Airways A380. Seats very comfortable, great leg room and much larger entertainment screen. Food acceptable, has improved since last trip. However, Premium Economy section is now so big you lose any exclusive experience that you used to enjoy on older aircraft. Also, what do you have to do to get a window seat.? Even as a Ruby member able to select a seat 7 days in advance I have just found it to be impossible. Who or what do those guys sitting in the window seats know? Return leg on the Boeing 747-400, old but in good condition and very clean. Still no window seat but I do feel that Premium Economy is well worth the extra coin.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways online check in policy is now most appalling. Four times I have flown with them and three times myself and my girlfriend have been placed apart. This is even though we were on the same booking and once this has happened in business. British Airways charge you just for selecting a seat. Not a better seat, just any seat other than that automatically selected for you! The system seems designed to deliberately place you apart, even though it knows that you are together. Then it charges you £18 per seat to change your seat. If neither you or your partner have an empty seat next to you then you have to pay to move both seats just to be together. They also won't let you checkin until 24 hours before so you have to spend one hour of your holiday going online and paying for the privilege of sitting together. Both these practices are archaic, even with Ryanair, they place you together in the system and if you pay to change you get priority boarding. Monarch only charge you to get a better quality seat. With Ryan Air you can also checkin your return at the same time as your outward. British Airways have sunk to new depths and I will not fly them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to São Paulo with British Airways was one of the most uncomfortable business class flights I have taken in recent years. The Boeing 747-400 is old and tired. BA claim their seat is 6'0 long. Not very comfortable when you're 6'6\". The seats are narrow and very uncomfortable. Previous week I travelled to Hong Kong with Emirates from the UK Maybe BA should checkout the competition! I am travelling back to the UK tomorrow and not looking forward to 11 hours of discomfort. The last time I will travel with BA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Check in a Gatwick for flight to Grenada was quick and efficient with British Airways. Boarding was unusually organised and we departed on time. The seats were OK, the food and drink was OK and the service was just OK, which really sums up BA. Not great, not bad, just OK. Despite having priority labels on our luggage our cases were among the last 6 to arrive although I don't suppose that was BA's fault.: 1 occurrences\n",

Boarding from Gate A8 onto a Boeing 767 which appeared pretty old and not very clean, but fine for a 1hr 20min flight. A hot breakfast served which was nice, the flight was only half full. Return the BA app refused to work so checked in at the airport, quick security quick and had time in the Galleries lounge. A newish A320, seat 2F which was fine with the aircraft an all economy layout. During the 1hr flight served a coffee and snack.

We entered at 5:30pm and the only food available was sandwiches, very poor decided to wait till the dinner service on board, good drinks selection. Boarded and soon seated with a glass of bubbles, the crew for a change were competent and approachable on both legs but slightly more mature. To be honest don't have a problem with BA but find they are lagging behind other major airlines whose lounges and service is far superior!: 1 occurrences\n",

Great crew on the outward flight and whilst we were in economy we were treated to champagne to celebrate a fiftieth birthday and offered the usual complimentary drinks. Two hot meals outbound were tasty. Return also fine but dinner was a bit dodgy, chicken gnocchi allegedly but hot breakfast compensated for this. Although the flights were full it was quiet and managed to get some sleep. Only slight criticism is the in flight entertainment. Not much of a selection in comparison to other airlines.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Washington to Dubai via London return with British Airways. My concern is regarding seat allocation. When we booked our flight (2 adults, one child and one infant), the seats with the bassinets for the infants were not available. We then chose 3 seats together on the side. I presumed that those are granted first come first served, based on the needs of the passengers that are traveling with children. Nonetheless, in 3 out of the 4 flights we took, those seats were taken by single individuals with no children/infants accompanying them. I asked at the check in if the seats with the bassinets were occupied by people with infants and the ground attendant responded by \"yes\". That was not the case, unfortunately. The flights were therefore very uncomfortable due to not having a place for the infant while food and drinks were served. I do not understand that when you try to book those seats with the bassinet, the system does not grant priority to the people traveling with infants. British Airways should consider that instead of having passengers with the hassle of keeping their infants on their laps for 7-8 hours while the bassinets are empty. The priority seating chart is for that purpose useful.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew to Kuala Lumpur with British Airways on an old Boeing 777-200 in business class (upgrade) which was OK although choice of IFE very poor. Crew pleasant but not particularly efficient and since my wife and I were seated together in the middle rear-facing seats it is an odd practice to serve us separately - her meals were served well before mine. Flight was punctual and we had a few hours sleep. Coming back was in Premium Economy and might as well have been on a different airline. Same old plane with TV screens extremely small. Meals not particularly great. The main difference is that British Airways crew treat anybody flying in a lower class as lesser individuals and they are bordering on rude. They forget that whatever class of cabin you are flying in that you are the customer and pay their wages. Next time Malaysia Airlines I think.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Washington to Heathrow with British Airways and I have to say that the IAD ground crew and inflight crew are fantastic. I sprained my neck just 2 days before departure and was given the option to pre board, which made all the difference. The flight itself was amazing - the A380 is just like a rock in the sky, I didn't feel a thing. The seat comfort on the upper deck in coach is more than adequate - in fact it reminds me of economy plus on United. The premium economy is more like domestic business class on most US carriers (older style business class not the new business first). The major downside - as I write this in the middle of my trip - is the ground staff at Heathrow. They are hard to find if they even exist. I'm in the middle of a terminal to terminal connection, still wearing my brace - and when asking about gate assignments and better options for seating, the best I got was a brusque \"sorry that's all there is.\" When you see someone limping away from your desk - at least ask if they'd like some assistance getting to the departure lounge. I know that with United, they may not offer club access for free, but you can at least buy it and I have found their ground staff at Heathrow far superior to the UK's flagship carrier - unfortunately.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Copenhagen to Accra via London Heathrow. After a chaotic boarding, the flight LHR-ACC was smooth with comfortable seats which felt softer than the newer and narrower. Food was good, the attitude of cabin staff positive and professional and the movie selection good. I was however surprised by the smaller Audio selection than experienced on previous flights, especially concerning rhytmical music. 1.5 hour before landing a second serving took place. It was a good experience flying BA, and I do not hesitate in recommending this airline. Only concern is the limited space for hand luggage - BA should more strictly control the hand luggage of the passengers is within the limits given - way too many passsengers ignored this on this and the return flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London Heathrow to Munich. Generally excellent both ways except the poor seat space. Flights on time, nice new / refurbished plane, cabin crew worked hard throughout. Food actually quite decent - nice breakfast out and tea on the way back. Sadly the seat space same as economy, when the guy in front reclined I couldn't even open the paper, just about ok for 90 minutes. So worth paying a little more for against economy but not too much.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Stockholm to London Heathrow was not a pleasant experience. British Airways has a good way of reminding you that you're flying cattle class. The interior was tired and worn, and the seat was hard. The legroom was inadequate for a short-haul flight. The cabin service was variable, while some were courteous, others practically barked at you. One steward even tapped me and gestured me for a refill.  On the bright side, there seems to be a lot of generosity with alcohol. I have had the fortune of sitting in front of three very loud and progressively intoxicated ladies who pressed for the stewardess for more alcohol every 10 minutes on the flight - requests promptly obliged. Perhaps I should have taken the advantage of this generosity to make the flight more bearable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Helsinki return. Check in at T3 quick as was fast track security. I visited the BA lounge in T3 which is nice and used by other Oneworld airlines, apart from being packed there was very limited food on offer at 10am. Boarding was slow and done by bus to a remote stand, onboard the seated in 1A with a fee seat next to me. I was looking forward to something decent to eat due to the lack of food options in the lounge - unfortunately the food offered was pretty basic to say the least. The crew where friendly which I guess was something. Arriving in Helsinki on time to another remote stand and bus transfer bags where off quickly despite any priority tagging. Check in for the return was quick, security a little slow but once through I headed for the Finnair lounge which was packed with no seating. I managed to find a seat in a computer booth have a coffee and check my emails. Boarding was awful with no priority and once again a 10 minute bus ride on a packed bus to then stand in the freezing cold and sleet for a further 10 minutes boarding via steps. After a delayed 1hr departure service began with a drink followed by another very basic meal of 3 half sandwiches and a scone. Crew were okay and kept passengers updated on the delayed arrival. Finally arrived 1 hr late but with the luxury of an airbridge. Bags off quickly which was good. Otherwise a business class on a 3hr flight with no in seat power, economy seating with middle seat blocked. Standard food offered in economy on other airlines. There is no class in BA's European business class anymore. Added to the poor downgrading of the BA frequent flier scheme it's a no brainer for me.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Heathrow to Toronto with British Airways. Fast check-in and security. Galleries Lounge very crowded, poor food offering and the furniture and toilets were not very clean. Boarding started on time for a 1705 departure but was suddenly stopped when it was announced that there was a technical problem and a new departure time of 1955 was given. This was later amended to 2100 and later to 1500 the next day : no details of the technical problem were provided. It is extraordinary that BA do not have a better resilience plan for these incidents when they occur at their home base - such a lengthy delay is unacceptable. Hotels/meals etc were organised fairly efficiently but not once was any offer made to re-accommodate on other flights until I made a fuss (due to commitments the next day) and was reluctantly booked on Air Canada at 0900 the next morning ; it had empty seats in both J and Y cabins. Several e-mails to BA Customer Service about this have yielded the usual stereotypical and nonsensical responses - they have ensured that I will never travel with BA again, we do have a choice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Toronto to Heathrow, my last flight with British Airways. Check-in and security efficient and quick : lounge was fine and the food provided for pre-flight dinner was tasty and perfectly adequate. Departure about 45 minutes late but this time was made up with a 5hr 55 min trip. Cabin comfort and service pretty much the norm for British Airways Business Class : no storage around the seat and the IFE screen did not work as usual. Breakfast has improved slightly ; the fruit was varied and edible, croissants warm but the bacon and egg muffin was unfortunately cold. Arrival processes fine.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways outbound flight from London Gatwick to Marrakech was comfortable. Being a Silver member I was able to choose the seats in advance (exit overwing) which had adequate leg room for this short flight (3.5 hrs). Meals are now just confined to sandwiches, all vegetarian, plus tea or coffee, plus one other drink with snacks. There was plenty of room for luggage in the overhead lockers. Return flight was a bit chaotic on boarding, and our priority tagged luggage did not receive priority treatment.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I travelled from Vancouver to Lisbon with a connection in London on January 9th 2016. Our flight was late - which does happen - however we had a to run to catch our connector flight resulting in our luggage not following us - upon arrival in Lisbon no luggage. We were told our luggage by the local luggage handlers who contacted British Airways would be on the next flight 3.5 hours later - we were given the option of waiting or have it delivered to our place of residence. We had no option but wait since the keys to our residence were in the luggage. 3.5 hours we came to claim our luggage and only 2 pieces out of 3 showed up. Again going through the local baggage handlers they now informed us that our remaining luggage would now be shipped the next morning, 14 hours later - again they gave us the option of delivering the luggage unfortunately our keys were inside. We had no choice but stay in a hotel in Lisbon and wait. I was disappointed but understand things don't go as planned sometimes. We contacted British Airways upon our return to inform them of the experience. The response was less than friendly this is why my review. They replied saying they are not responsible for any luggage. Really? When I purchase my tickets I got an email to make sure that luggage specification on luggage allowed by the airline in question. My understanding with our ticket purchase in piece of luggage no more than 23 Kgs per passenger and 1 Carry on. Where did I go wrong.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Geneva. Very efficient check in, the plane was a newish, clean and comfortable A320 (better than BA's old 737s), pleasant crew, OK food for the time of day, good value and it arrived on time. The odd thing is that BA does not currently have its own lounges at Gatwick but uses third party lounges which are not as good. This is dependent on BA switching terminals but nobody had a timescale for this. This needs sorting out!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My first time in First class on any airline. Joined the flight from a connection so didn't do First check in but boarded without incident. Met at the door by the purser, greeted by name and shown to my seat. Masses of space, very comfortable and private, given it is semi-open. Not a huge amount of storage around the seat but my case fitted into my personal locker at the front of my seat. My partner and I were in 4E/4F at the back of the cabin, (front of the lower deck). No disturbance from the galley. Choose a window seat if travelling alone. Being a day flight, we didn't have beds made up. The cabin is classic yet contemporary and elegant. Pre-departure drinks included Grand Siecle Champagne. We both chose the tasting menu option. I didn't like the lobster starter and staff substituted a course from the a la carte menu. Food was outstanding and wine pairing worked well. To be a bit fussy, the steak was overcooked to the point of being unenjoyable. IFE was good although no time to watch movies. The screen is attached to the side of the seat and has to be docked for take off and landing (as in Club World), which is very irritating. First off the plane, although that doesn't matter much as immigration at MIA is always a nightmare. I've flown BA for many years in other cabins and cost cutting is evident everywhere. Their Club World is a joke compared to every long haul competitor but First is still a world leader. I was very pleased to fly BA and relieved that they still have it when it comes to cosseting in first class. I paid for this flight as part of a return itinerary but took the train from London to Paris to start (flew Club Europe from there to Heathrow) and then Economy class back to Paris on American Airlines. This was significantly cheaper than flying directly from Heathrow. Still not cheap but well worth it and looking forward to the next time. My recommendation is for First class - the other cabins are average at best, although I will still be flying BA regularly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways business Class from Edinburgh to Las Vegas return via Heathrow. Cabin crew on both flights were very helpful and attentive. Part of the business class cabin on the 747 is located in the upper cabin with 20 seats and two dedicated crew. The seating configuration however is just odd. The window seat faces backwards and aisle street faces forwards. There is a privacy screen, but if you are not travelling with a friend or family member you'll be looking at a complete stranger for the duration of your flight. The cabin crew have to stretch over the person in the aisle seat to serve drinks and meals. If you have a window seat you have no option either but to climb over the person in the row behind you if they have their seat in flatbed position. On arrival at Las Vegas after an hour or so wait at the carousel with at least a hundred people including myself didn't get their luggage. Thereafter we all had to wait in line whilst 2 British Airways staff dealt with a very tired and annoyed group of people. A $200 gesture was welcomed but this didn't really compensate for the inconvenience. Return flight with speedy check in and great service onboard.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew from EDI-LHR-PHL-LHR-EDI in World Traveller. Outbound shuttle to Heathrow was a Boeing 767-300 in all economy layout, managed to bag seats 1F/1G using online checkin. Cheery, friendly crew - biggest problem is the excessive hand baggage allowance permitted on BA. Selfish people take huge cases on board, filling up the lockers so everyone with more modestly sized items can't get a look in. Cabin crew quite stressed trying to move cases around lockers to get everyone sat down. LHR-PHL upgraded to the rearmost group of two seats on Row 35 on  Boeing 777-200. BA has now cheekily increased the cost of these to £48 each - used to be only £33 like the rest of the cabin. Wisecracking captain over the tannoy made the flight a little more entertaining - again great crew, I could eat the meal for once. Only thing that went wrong was the IFE on my seat crashed in the last 90 minutes of the flight - I could only view the flight tracker. On a side note, I wish BA would upgrade the album choice, they haven't changed it in the last year. Flight was on time no delays. Inbound PHL-LHR I reserved a seat for £33 each, but note you cannot buy the back row on the middle group - reserved for the crew. Plane encountered severe turbulence between Nantucket and Newfoundland, crew had to rush the drinks and the meal service as a result.  No apologies from the pilots about this which BA usually does. LHR-EDI problems about excessive hand baggage exacerbated on the smaller A320.  It was the same steward by sheer coincidence that served us on the outbound shuttle a week earlier and he did remember us, and asked us how our holiday in Philadelphia went! Otherwise flight was pleasant and did what it said on the tin. Overall it was a good value trip - I booked it through BA Holidays, and it being off-season meant the total cost was £940 (before seat upgrades) including 8 days car rental. One observation however it that it is now clear that BA cares little about its economy passengers (who now seem to exist to make up the numbers) - everything now seems to be geared around their high-spending Executive Club members. Avios earning has been drastically cut in the World Traveller cabin class, so a discounted fare now only attracts 0.25 Avios in the mile. Therefore a transatlantic flight to the East Coast of the USA (which used to get 3250 points), now only attracts a measily 815. Pretty pathetic really. I really only use British Airways via LHR for USA trips purely on the basis of using large widebody planes (unlike American and United who increasingly use Boeing 757s) , and their holidays deals which are hard to beat and enable payment instalments.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Excellent British Airways flight from Venice to Gatwick, seemed to be a brand new A320 with leather seats. Friendly staff and decent quick sandwich and a drink. My gripe is that too many people bring cases on board, leaving little room for people who've paid for hold luggage, to stow their backpacks etc. Same as on EasyJet.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Business Class from Heathrow to Chennai. Check in was painless and went to the Terminal 5 lounge which was very busy but well stocked with refreshments / food. Boarding was painless and was greeted with champagne. The pods alternately faced forwards and rearwards, so choose carefully if you like a particular orientation. Seat was comfortable. Perhaps not being especially tall or wide meant there was plenty of wriggle room for me. Movie selection for me was fine (I am not a regular cinema goer). TV screen was adequate although my old eyes could've done with something slightly wider. Rounds of drinks and snacks outside meal time. Dinner was good - I had a mixture of a western starter and asian main. Breakfast was ok - eggs were solid bullets, but everything else great. The crew were pleasant.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Decided to upgrade and treat myself to BA's Club World. Check in at JFK was efficient. Fast track through to security was a breeze. BA's Galleries Lounge at JFK T7 was shared with Cathay Pacific and LOT Polish Airline. The lounge was spacious and clean. I was encouraged to have my dinner in the lounge as the service is a sleeper service. To my disappointmwnt, there wasn't enough food left although the selections were good but not the best. After my pre-flight dining, I decided to have a shower. The shower rooms were clean and amenities available on request. BA's Club World seat is around 20 inches wide which was very comfortable for the quick 5 hour flight back home. I was greeted by my name by the cabin crew who were friendly. IFE option was the same as flying economy clasd.  Menu was handed out a along with Elemis amenity kit. The meals were good but portions could be better. Upon arrival in LHR, bags were delivered on time. I was told to pay a visit to their arrivals lounge but I didn't bother. Overall, I would fly with BA's Club World product again. Seat and bed was very comfortable and well maintained despite the ageing aircraft. Cabin crew friendly and enthusiastic. Just one thing that BA might want to consider is the food portions because their portions are baby sized portions.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew with BA in economy class on their third oldest Boeing 777-300ER. Boarding was delayed due to the late arrival of aircraft. The aircraft is showing its age but the interior is clean. Flying on this B773ER was with their new economy class, seat pitch only 31 inches but is bearable for the 8 hour flight. Meal service was delayed due to turbulence. Choices were cheese and omelette or mixed grill, I went for the latter which was good although portions could be better. Second meal service was just a sandwich and a sweet. Staff professional and interactive with passengers. IFE with a handful of new Hollywood films. Audio choices could be better. Tip: Avoid A and K seats due to the IFE box restricting your legroom.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways domestic economy only from London Heathrow to Edinburgh and basically the only option on this and many routes, check in at T5 quick my Frequent flier status is about to be downgraded however I still have it for a few more weeks, so availed the fast track security and used the BA T5 north lounge. Boarding at A5 quick on to a full flight departed on time, on board service okay for a 1hr flight. Drinks and a snack served arrival almost on time. Return early flight with quick bag drop security a bit slow otherwise used the BA lounge before boarding a full 767, departed on time and arrived early service okay with a breakfast served with drinks, although the crew missed me out and appeared grumpy when I later asked for a coffee. It's an okay service can be expensive if booked at short notice but gets you from A to B quickly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Recently flew back from JFK to LHR and not the greatest flight I've ever been on. The seats were uncomfortable, poor leg room for long haul ( electrical box under seat infront) unedible food. Poor selection of onboard entertainment. The only good thing about my flight was the staff! My outbound flight was booked with BA but operated by American Airlines - so much better!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Zurich to London Heathrow to Kotoka International and back: Outward flight from LHR to Accra fully booked, old B747 cabin looks a bit shabby, seats are worn and tight. The crew however made up for it with a friendly attitude, food was pretty good for economy class. Flight back was delayed by over 24 hours due to a busted parking brake. Communication at the airport could be better but BA offered accomodation and meals during the waiting time. After the problem was solved the flight was leaving the next night and was uneventful. I even managed to lie down and sleep a few hours as the cabin was only half full. What really amazed me was how the BA Customer Service managed my request of compensation. After a couple of days they contacted me and transferred the due amount. I therefore really must commend BA for this straightforward service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Helsinki to London via Helsinki. The flexibility, readiness, and kindness of the cabin crew reminded me why I have appreciated BA in the past and continue to do so: they do what they say they will do, and do it well.

No reason to fly British Airways club in the future and they have lost my business until aircraft configuration and service improve.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "One feature of British Airways these days, is that its product can be so variable. On this basis, I had low expectations of a recent flight from Heathrow to Athens. The plane was an old 767 and being phased out. However the crew were professional and attentive, food was good, plenty of drink available and the inflight entertainment comprised the latest Star Wars movie. Given the very low price I paid for the ticket - no complaints. My worry is the accountants that run the airline and always chipping away at the soft product.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight from Heathrow to Chicago  delayed over three hours, with a litany of excuses for Boeing 747-400 going tech, faulty smoke alarm in toilet, catering truck damaged fuselage door, engineers couldn't correct fault. BA would not let us off the flight. Captain came to First Class and answered questions, which was a nice personal touch. When we finally got going, food and cabin service were very mediocre. BA First Class seat is a very, very poor product, and entertainment screen slow. IAD-LHR return on the A380 in First Class. The A380 is a wonderful aircraft, woefully let down by the poor BA First Class seats and service, the seats are barely Business Class by modern standards, and the dinner service was inelegant and almost inedible. Crew on return were impersonal, and keen to get the dinner service over. Finally, BA Customer Relations (based in India) responded to the 3+ hours delay by declining my claim with an insincere form letter. They also don't appear to have a good grasp of English. Overall, the end-to-end experience with BA was poor, and evidently they don't care. It is far, far, short of a First Class experience. This is what you get with a quasi-monopoly to the USA from London. The only merit was the superb A380. Let us hope BA replace their aged Boeing 747-400 with this aircraft, but in doing so, improve the terrible seat configuration of First and Club Class.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew Ibiza to Gatwick with British Airways. A massive and slow moving queue in Ibiza at 11.30pm was not a good start. No announcement about a delay but plane took off 45 minutes late.

Flight was not busy compared to totally full outbound flight a few days before but return ticket was costly.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Travelled British Airways from London to Nairobi return and excellent flight both ways - outbound crew were not quite as good as the inbound crew but I wouldn't complain about. I think the Premium economy seats were a new type or at least the covering, I find it much more comfortable than the leather type, almost up to the comfort of Virgin's A340 seats when they used to go to Nairobi. Had one problem with entertainment equipment on the return flight, it was locked up on the announcement screen, despite no announcements being made, but there were empty seats we could have used. Is premium economy worth the money, in my case I say yes, 22 stone, on a 6ft 2in, 73 year old frame does not like journeys much over 3 hours in standard economy. Check in both ends good - as is usual at Nairobi with multiple security checks, but its a known fact that different people notice different things, so I see multiple checks are a good thing.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways, Athens - London Heathrow - Los Angeles and return. Shorthaul - it seems the drink service is less often than usual compared to previous BA flights. The new slimline seats feel more spacious, but in my opinion it has less padding compared to the old ones. Food quite good, pilots great as always. Longhaul - Upperdeck A380. Food main courses quite decent but the snacks inbetween and in the galley absolutely terrible. Seats feel very cramped on the A380 in economy class. Also unacceptable to charge so much to choose seats. A380 always seems to have a delayed departure (plane too big for its own good?) Entertainment fairly good. Will be interesting to compare with the competition, as plan on trying another airline next time.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "Austin to London Heathrow. I spent a considerable amount of time in Jan and Feb, booking these seats, and I had to pay over £70 for the privilege. BA systems were not working properly and I had to get phone help - to find the cause, but at the 15th attempt, I managed to book the seats. I like a window seat, mid cabin, in a number that divides by 3. Our flight was called, I went to the gate, with people behind me. The bar code on the bag drop issued boarding pass wouldnt scan. He asked his colleague who had other boarding passes, that still wouldnt scan. His other colleague thought it might be my passport and went off to check. I made the point that I had been in the airport three hours so if there was something wrong, surely they could have contacted me? The colleague came back. The bar codes still wouldnt scan and I heard one of them say 'they are already through'. I said I had booked a window seat for hubby and hoped the new one was. He said they were but by their numbers I could see they werent. Got on board. There was someone already in those seats!! I found an attendant, who went off and found us two seats. No window, across the aisle from the loo. So all night we heard the loo flushing and got bumped by people waiting and falling about due to turbulence. That would be why they were free.  I did look to where my booked seats were. There was a family of five in that row, that obviously wanted to be together. So though I was in a different bit of the cabin that might have been premium economy, as I was offered a hot flannel and some warm fizzy win in a plastic glass, I was certainly not upgraded. Doesn't matter if you pay for seat reservations, 6 weeks in advance. If somebody comes along later they'll turf you into cattle class. And to think I stopped using Ryanair!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Helsinki - London Heathrow - Mumbai on A320 and B777W including a transit from T3 to T5 at Heathrow. The A320 felt quite cramped in Economy but the energetic and motivated cabin crew made the flight enjoyable. Later on were very happy to have the bigger and newer Boeing 777W on the Mumbai sector, where the last few rows had empty seats and we were able to stretch our legs properly, which was a great bonus. The IFE was good and the 2 hot meals served quite tasty and filling. In addition, the cabin crew were again excellent. On the way back flight was more than 2.5hrs late out of BOM which would have meant a missed connection at LHR late Saturday night, the last flight out to HEL that night. Asked the BOM station manager to be put on Jet Airways since they seemed to be on time, had to wait until the very last minute due to a fully booked flight, but finally got two seats on Jet to catch the connecting flight at LHR the same evening. The very positive experience with BA on HEL-LHR-BOM as well as the rerouting that was carried out in an exemplary manner make us praise British Airways. Very good experience made by experienced and cooperative BA staff at all stations. Will fly again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana in economy and flew back in Premium economy. Was it worth it? Well we didn't pay too much more, so probably overall yes - just about. But other than slightly more legroom you don't get much! Same food as economy as far as I could tell. Main meal was nice. Breakfast was not good enough for an airline of this supposed calibre - small cold cheese croissant and muesli bar! Only one tea/coffee round and then they whipped round to collect the empties. We got to board before the economy passengers but that's no big deal. We had to pay extra to secure seats at the side in a pair. Otherwise, we would have had to sit in a block of 4 in the middle which we don't like. I begrudged paying the extra for this to be honest. Captain was cheery and informative, and apologised endlessly for the short delay leaving Punta Cana. Crew were polite but not friendly. Ours was an older guy who had an air of 'I've been doing this a long time and I'm pretty fed up with passengers'. Whilst I can understand this,  if you feel like that about your job, you need to move on. The flight only landed slightly late and having made up a lot of time en route would have been on time had it not been for air traffic congestion at Gatwick which I can well believe. Same old awful out of date IFE. Seats, despite being wider, were very uncomfortable.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Moscow. I have been flying to Moscow with British Airways for a few years now, today I flew to Moscow and the long haul aircraft Boeing 747 / Boeing 767 have now been replaced by the A321 which is not as enjoyable, and the seats are very uncomfortable. What disappointed me the most was the meal which was served, it is a four hour flight from London to Moscow and all they served was a Cheese Sandwich and a Kit Kat! I would have thought that on a flight of this length there would be a hot meal. The majority of the flight attendants were also very good at not making eye contact either which was disappointing too. As a Gold frequent flyer, I would expect a much higher level of service, it is a shame there there are not other airlines flying direct to Moscow as I would be using these in the future.: 1 occurrences\n",

But very friendly staff at premium check-desk helped and checked me in without fuss. Boarding process rather messy, boarding staff gave different and contradicting instructions and organized a chaos. Most economy class passengers could board the aircraft first. Crew was efficient and sometimes friendly with rather typical BA attitude: staff is chatting away when working and having fun amongst themselves. As a client one feels bad to interrupt their conversation with a request.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "On our recent British Airways flight from Mauritius to London, we decided to pay for an upgrade. Only to find when we got on the plane that the seats given to us were not functional. We had no entertainment on the 12 hour flight, no power to the seat so could not even read. British Airways are not willing to offer us a refund on the upgrade, as they advise their responsibility is to get us from A to B. The entertainment system are all additional and not part of the ticket price. Even though looking at their website they state \"personal entertainment system with noise-reducing headphones\" as one of the selling points for upgrading or flying premier economy. The fact that we did not even get to watch the security video is not a concern to BA. As someone who flies BA a lot, they have just lost a customer and do not care. I would avoid flying BA now. Terrible service.: 1 occurrences\n",

Meals were typically British, notably using British brands or dishes, and acceptable, IFE and moving-map were a touch old-fashioned and clunky, small screen and limited selection, but still just about adequate. Seat-foam was thin, and movements of the passenger behind could often be felt, which was irritating. Cabin-crew on this 12-hour full flight were very hard-working. Would use airline again, at the right price.: 1 occurrences\n",

      "We spent extra to be upgraded to First to fly from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth. It was definitely not worth it. The 777 has smaller first class seats, they have expanded the number of seats, too. There are now around 20. Cabin crew were young and clearly without enough experience. Quite unhelpful and it took a long time to get meals - they have been \"taught\" to do everyone individually. That doesn't work when they have expanded the number of passengers. Cabin crew clearly felt their only responsibility was to feed us. They disappeared after lunch for many hours - until it was time for tea. Which is now a meal less adequate than it used to be in Club. Further, First Class food is far from first class. Fewer choices, and what is provided is not good. Very disappointing. First Class in BA used to be restful and the food was decent.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "New York JFK - London Heathrow, BA174, Club World seat 62K. If you are travelling Club World with BA, the upper deck on the 747 is the best option for that \"private jet feel\". Seat 62K is a great seat with window lockers, more space and no one climbing over you. The food was very good and the entertainment system was the new Panasonic version with plenty of choice and improve sound and picture quality. I managed a couple of hours sleep as it was a relatively short flight.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from London to Calgary. Flight from B gates at T5, lounge there so much better than in main terminal, but poor selection of food mid-afternoon. First time on Dreamliner. Was ok but not noticeably a major improvement from 747 other than the IFE which was excellent. Had the steak main course which was the best of a bad bunch. Late takeoff and most of time made up. Have seen the damning comments on here about slipping standards but my recent experiences have been good.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I was very impressed with the World Traveller Plus experience on British Airways from London Heathrow to San Francisco. Obviously this is a very new aircraft for BA, but the seat and service experience really were very good and so much more pleasant than an economy flight. I had a window seat, so benefited from the extra space afforded by the location of the storage cabinets underneath the windows. The seat was very comfortable situated on the upper deck in the A380 which is a very quiet plane to travel in, and I enjoyed a couple of movies on the large screen with great sound via the supplied noise cancelling headset. The food was pretty good, and alcohol freely served. The only negative experience was being turned back from priority boarding at LHR even though I have Ruby status with BA. The ground agent was a little condescending in the way he handled it to be honest and of course I felt embarrassed in front of the other passengers, but the signage by the priority boarding lane clearly indicated that Ruby travelers had the benefit of priority boarding. I was a 10 year qualifying Gold Card holder on British Midland, but BA has chosen to not recognise all the frequent travelers who achieved this status over a decade of loyalty to the airline they bought claiming they had no lifetime member status in Executive Club, however I believe this is now something they do in fact offer. This is why I have reduced my score to 8/10, otherwise full marks.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Gatwick to Punta Cana. Where to begin? I'll start with the check in at Gatwick, having checked in online I was expecting a relatively simple baggage drop off, how wrong could I be. 4 desks servicing every flight, we arrived at the airport 4 hours before the scheduled departure time and spent 3 of these in the baggage drop off queue. Due to the slow service many passengers were getting called forward to jump the queue so as to not miss the flight. The staff on the desks looked thoroughly miserable and spent more time talking to each other than dealing with the customers. Security checks were surpsingly efficient but due to the time taken to drop off the bags we had no time to visit any shops and had to go straight to the gate, despite having arrived 4 hours early. Onboard the aircraft things improved a little, the food was good and the crew very attentive however the IFE is very dated on the Gatwick based 777s, my screen kept jumping every 3-4 seconds and stopped functioning completely an hour into the flight. The crew tried to reset the system but when it reset I no longer had the option to choose what to watch and could only watch the old style video loop. This wouldn't have been a problem for me if not for the fact that I paid an extra £38 on top of the ticket price to choose a seat. Overall a negative experience but I can't fault the cabin crew or the inflight service.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to Calgary. It's hard to know quite what makes a 787 more comfortable (less dry air, quieter or bigger windows?), but this service was good. The IFE was excellent and a cut above the older systems on some BA flights. Very nice crew and good food and drink. My only complaint is that lunch was served at 4pm London time followed by tea at about midnight. Why not tea after take off and dinner at say 8?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Warsaw to Heathrow, and the check in is only open 2 hours before, and I wanted to shop and eat. British Airways is the only one that I could see that had such a late check in.

      "Milan Malpensa to London Heathrow with British Airways. 1.25 hrs standing in queue to check in due to \"new system installed last month running slow\". So why no extra staff to cope with this? Plane then cancelled 30 mins after time, due to technical issue. No systems in place to cope with the size of what then needed to be done. Everyone had to re-claim baggage, exit via passport control and queue at service desk to re-book. Unbelievably, desk staffed by only one person. People with onward connections were being given priority so their journey could be re-planned but each of these took 10 to 15 mins to process, with a line of 100+ people waiting behind. Thus by the time one person had been served another had been prioritised to front of queue, meaning that the queue was effectively not moving. Over 3 hours later a third of the queue was still standing in line waiting to be processed. It was only the self-discipline of those in the queue that prevented this descending into total chaos. Why not two terminals so the onward travellers could be dealt with separately from those with simple needs? Why no seating and no queue management system? Pathetic response to what must be a an occasional problem. Then had to re-present to re-check-in again via their slow 'new system' and go again through security (mercifully top class) and passport control for evening flight. Those who'd queued longest stayed in hotel to travel next day. No meal vouchers offered. No compensation details offered, tho given when asked for.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bucharest to London Heathrow and the worst thing above all are the British Airways business class seats and the shocking lack of legroom. Cramped into a space which is less than many economy seats. And this was Club Europe! Poor breakfast - one slice of bacon, half tomato a few tinned mushrooms and an omelette so overcooked it was grey inside. Seat itself was comfortable and staff were good. Toilet waste bin had tape around it and so a sack was used for rubbish instead! Not a good flight overall.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "First time my partner and I have flown British Airways for some years and we will not be returning after our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. I booked the flights several months before and had to pay £40 to pre-select our seats both ways (£160). On both outward and inward flights my entertainment system was not working. Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have \"bounced a child on it.\" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. I certainly wouldn't pay BA's rate for Premium Economy again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Montreal to Rome via London with British Airways. Boarded the plane on time (20.30hrs) and sat for six hours on the tarmac while BA tried to clear a glitch in the landing gear system. They finally gave up and cancelled the flight. I had to get to Rome to catch a cruise ship that was departing at 8pm on Tuesday evening, and here I am in Montreal at 1pm Monday, Rome time. British Airways ticket agent refused to help me change my itinerary (\"Go to the hotel on the bus and at 2pm today - local time - we will have new itineraries for everyone.\"). I tried to explain the urgency to my situation but she cut me off, \"I can't help you, if I help you now I have to help everyone.\" When I pressed her further she gave me the BA 800 number, which was closed due to the late hour. Finally I called British Airways Reservations in London, who re-routed me, on American Airlines. The final kick: I put in a claim for a wasted night's guaranteed stay in Rome, and for cancellation compensation. A month later, British Airways advised me that my claim was approved and I would receive payment in two weeks. Since then, nothing for the last 6 weeks. Phone calls to customer support involve at least a 40 minute hold. What a horrid excuse for customer service!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Dubai and I feel sorry for British Airways. I have just flown one of my last ever flights with them as they have fallen into the depths of being second rate against far superior competition. The lounges at T5 Heathrow should be great, but we arrived last night at 6pm to find almost all the food offer finished, so it's soup or a jacket potato and beans then! So much nicer to spend £20 and buy a decent meal from one of the many eateries in T5 instead. Then onto the plane which was tired. As usual, bits of all 4 of our seats were broken. My wife's tv. My sound only worked in the left ear. A really dirty blanket (and no spares at all). Very late food service. But to be fair, and for a change, the stewardesses weren't their usual BA indifferent style but fairly good and certainly polite. But this is business class, and it certainly doesnt feel like it any more. I try to support British jobs, but Emirates is cheaper and better.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I took four flights with British Airways last month - Johannesburg via London Heathrow to New York JFK and return. On all the service was excellent. At the three airports again all went smoothly. With BA the unknown is the age of the plane that you get. The A380 was excellent, quiet, clean and good space - I was on the upper deck; the B777 also good with reasonable space and good entertainment, the B747 less so - one had been upgraded and the other - the final leg - LHR to JFK was old - seats reasonably comfortable but the entertainment system aged - screen the size of a large postage stamp - and poor picture. Really does depend how much the entertainment means to you I guess. I also tried the special menus from LHR - business quality food for which you pay a small premium. Well presented, tasty and a nice treat.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Thanks to a time change from 23.55 to 00.05, which brought forward our departure by almost 24 hours, we very nearly missed our flight back from Rio de Janeiro to London. The check-in desks were crowded out by Team GB athletes returning home from a training session and we were relieved to get the fast track treatment. The first/business lounge at GIG is one of the worst we've been in. Our seats were 1E/F and seemed marginally better than the first class seats on a 747, although still far off the standard of British Airways competitors. 1E/F also suffer from being near the galley and there was one crew member who spent much of the night talking away to her colleagues. 1A and 1K seemed to be occupied by BA employees and there was far too much schmoozing going on. Service on the whole was reasonably good, although none of the food on the menu was actually available. This was rather feebly blamed on the changeover from one month to the next. The IFE worked reliably and the large screen had a much better resolution than on 747s. Overnight the temperature in the cabin was set too high, which resulted in an uncomfortable sleep under the duvet in the pyjamas provided. The toilets on the 777 are ridiculously small and weren't well cleaned during the flight. Breakfast was the usual affair, with an atrociously rubbery omelette. Overall, the flight was okay, but not a first class experience.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Toronto to Entebbe via London with British Airways.

      "Zurich to London Heathrow with British Airways. The lounge at Zurich was fine. Reasonable selection of food and booze albeit a shared lounge. Given the number of flights on this sector one wonders why BA could not have a small personalised set up. But we are talking about BA where nothing is \"normal\". Flight was rammed. I doubt if you could get a field mouse on the plane it was so full. The plane left 25 minutes late - but with a couple of gin and tonics on the way I could not care less. Seats, the usual cramped 3 into 2 configuration that is unique to BA regional business class. A lousy set up. FA's were very friendly and provided great customer service. I complained about the high numbers of economy passengers hijacking the Club Europe WCs. I am not a snob by any means - but given I paid about £450 - one way for the ticket, surely ease of use for the loo is not unreasonable. FAs were sympathetic and I filled out a complaint card. All in all not bad, apart from the miserable seat and not being able to get off the plane quickly.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flying in Club Europe from London City to Berlin Tegel, returning in economy with British Airways. The outbound flight was delayed for nearly 1 hour. However, the journey itself was very smooth and enjoyable. The food offered in the CE cabin was delicious. Flying back in economy was an absolute nightmare. Everything went wrong from checking in, lounge access, baggage claim and extremely poor service relating to my missing luggage. I had done my online check in on my return flight. Just went to the check in counter to drop off my luggage. The check in agent offered me a paper boarding pass which later I discovered had been incorrectly issued to me. She checked me in under someone else who happens to have the same last name as mine. After I dropped off my luggage, I went to the business lounge as I am a silver member. I provided the recepitionist my paper boarding pass and entrance was declined. Not surprising given the fact that they gave me the wrong boarding pass. However, I showed the receptionist my silver status on my mobile app. She didn't even look at it and told me my membership had been downgraded on her system. she didn't investigate anything and asked me to call up BA which I didn't bother. When I was queuing up at the passport control, I noticed the destination shown on my boarding pass was incorrect. I approached the BA staff at the gate immediately after I had cleared through security. BA staff were shocked that I was checked in under someone else's name. Wrong name, Wrong flight etc. They asked me to go to the correct gate immediately, but then they also told me my checked luggage was on the wrong flight and I might not have it back upon arrival at LCY. They gave me a new luggage tag. After arriving at LCY, waited for 20mins, bag didn't show up. I approached the baggage claim agent who was on her phone. I explained the situation which she didn't really pay attention and asked me to stand next to the conveyor belt, insisting my luggage would arrive. Again, no investigation, rushed service and a bit rude. 3 days later - no luggage still despite the fact that they have located my luggage.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew economy class from Manchester to Johannesburg via London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight from Manchester to Heathrow delayed for over 2 hours, very crowded waiting area. We had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure (only available exactly 14 days before flight). This was well worth the money paid. The emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us, giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight. Again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality, well presented with proper cutlery, also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and relax. Good entertainment system. All the advantages of premium economy without the price. We had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from Heathrow. Dont know why it's not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class. Having used Virgin to fly to Jamaica for last 9 years are now going with BA into Kingston, hoping the service is as good. Only disappointment was with the return connecting flight to Manchester - again quite a long delay sat on tarmac with little explanation and a very rude attendant when my husband enquired about the delay. Note to BA - customers can accept delays if you explain why and at least offer them a drink while waiting, especially when it is early morning and most people are connecting from long overnight flights.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Club Europe flights from London Gatwick to Seville return. Outbound on 23/6/2016 return on 26/6/2016. Outbound flight was a victim of the French ATC strike and British Airways did their best to keep us informed about the status of the flight. They warned us that the lounge at Gatwick was closed and we used the No 1 lounge instead. Acceptable, but not of similar quality to the BA product we would have wished for. The outbound flight had a scheduled departure time of 15.25. Delayed 4 hours due to a combination of 1) French ATC strike (2 hours) 2) Blocked toilet on aircraft (20 minutes) 3) Change of seating configuration of the A320 that we were allocated (resulting in 13 economy passengers being bumped (45 minutes) 4) No ground crew to push us back from gate (remainder). Pilot and cabin crew did their best but were getting frustrated as were the passengers. Took off, reasonable inflight service outbound. Return flight, no lounge in Seville, no warning from BA on this. Reasonable inflight service. Slow baggage at LGW (so no surprise there!). Overall, reasonable product and I feel still worth the extra (but only just).: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Bangkok to London Heathrow on British Airways. I have lived in Thailand for 4 years now and try to go back to the UK at least once a year to visit family and friends. Normally, I fly either Emirates to Manchester or to Heathrow with EVA Air. This time around, BA came up with a fairly competitive price. The aircraft wasn't in particularly impressive shape and in-flight entertainment unit was quite outdated and didn't work for the first 2 hours of the flight. Once it did work, the screen was awful and very dark. I can't fathom why BA are using outdated entertainment systems when rivals such as EVA, Emirates and even Thai Airways are much more current. Inflight service was okay for the most part. Regular trips by the staff for refreshments in the first few hours, but this certainly died down afterwards. After using the call system to get the attention of a staff member, I was abruptly asked to switch it off and asked if I had a problem. No problem, just would like a drink please. However, alcohol (apart from wine) had ran out. I'm not a massive drinker, but do have a couple of whiskey and cokes on a flight. Also, there was no Wi-Fi, no charge points for mobile devices. This is again in contrast with Emirates, Thai Airways and EVA. All in all,  I have to say it was a disappointing experience. I won't be using BA again on my next flight to the UK.: 1 occurrences\n",

Clean cabin, cabin attendants were very helpful and willing to serve. Dinner was decent, with a good cup of English tea afterwards. Cabin was quiet for a good sleep. Entertainment system was OK, choices of films (mainly non-English ones) can be expanded. Cup noodles was offered as mid-flight snack. Breakfast was horrendous. As always very long immigration queues at Heathrow, especially when the flight is delayed with many other long haul flights landing before my flight. Overall good value for money.: 1 occurrences\n",

I filled in a form on line to get my £10 back and I will get a response apparently in 28 days. As you might have guessed this is not about £10, its about the fact that I had taken the time to ensure my journey was as comfortable as possible and the \"I dont give a damn\" attitude of British Airways once their mistake was discovered.

      "Late evening departure on BA28 from Hong Kong to Heathrow, plane fully booked (pre-Christmas season) in all classes. My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer. For me this means that it was most probably my last long distance flight on BA. No marks on inflight entertainment because I chose the sleep option.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Club class on British Airways between Cape Town and London. Boeing 747-400 has the flat bed and while the quality of the cabin was inferior to the A380 between London and Johannesburg, it remains one of the better business class product. Check in at the BA counters in Cape Town would have been a breeze, was it not for the unexpected six hour delay in the departure of the flight. The upgrade from Premium to Club class made this inconvenience almost bearable. However,  Cape Town airport becomes like a ghost town when all flights but yours have departed. BA's Executive lounge in Cape Town is spacious and serves good food and Cape wines. There are free internet and computers and a friendly service, even at midnight. While comfortable, BA's Club seats on the 747 can do with an upgrade. They are configured in a 2-4-2 layout, with one passenger facing forward and the one adjacent facing backward, at the side row - the middle row has two forward and two backward facing. This is something I never understood - why facing backward because it just makes no sense. The seats are separated by a hard plastic cseparator that moves up and down with the push of a button. Theoretically, the air hostess should walk behind the front-facing seat to serve the backward-facing passenger at the window - however, on my flight the air hostess insisted on leaning over me, pushing the button to lower the separator and serving the accross my seat - after about three times this really got annoying. The problem is that if you don't raise the separator, you and your fellow passengers stare straight at each other from a distance of less than one meter. Food was satisfactory, rather than outstanding. . The starter choices were poached Norwegian Salmon with marinated prawns or an oyster mushroom salad. Main courses included Ballotine of chicken with Port, Drakensberg trout, pasta or a cold main course salad of za'atar beef medallion. I chose the chicken and it was OK, but inferior to my mother's Sunday roast chicken. There was a selection of South African Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and some good reds. Breakfast was a choice of a cheese omelette, continental or a traditional English breakfast with bacon, sausages, mushrooms and potatoes. Arriving in London, I took the supposedly fast track option - a big mistake. In theory this is supposed to expedite your progress through customs as a Club passenger, but in practice it was a disaster - there were only two or three border agents present at any time and it took 45 to 60 minutes to get through the fast track immigration - I could see group after group of fellow BA passengers clearing the slow lane long before I took the next few steps forward. BA arrivals lounge was a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of Heathrow Terminal 5. All in all, not a bad experience, but having flown on these seats quite a few times over the past 15 or more years, I really think it is time to either upgrade the Club cabin on the 747's.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Just returned from Orlando to London via Miami, that we booked direct with British Airways. The outgoing flight was really good. However, a totally different story on the return flight. We were redirected to check in with American Airlines as we had an internal connecting flight. Although we checked in shortly after the check in opened, the only seating was preferred meaning we had to pay extra for flights we believed we had paid in full. Additionally my family was split up. The AA check in would not allow us to check into the long haul flight from Miami to London. After phoning we discovered we had been checked in but not allowed to choose seats. I've spent a week seeking an apology from BA customer services and I've had several stock responses and been left with the feeling that they really do not care about their customers. From their response it is quite clear they do not see AA as part of the same group \"one world alliance\" I used to be of the view that I didn't mind paying a bit more for BA as their service was really good, but unfortunately they now seem to offer a budget airline service. I post this purely to warn other families to be aware of the danger of booking with British Airways but having a connecting flight with another part of the \"one world alliance\".: 1 occurrences\n",

We flew an A380 and my seat was somewhere in the back on the upper deck. Enough legroom, entertainment system personalized and very easy to use. Although it was a day-flight we got additional to the usual blanket and pillow, a small toothbrush and paste. The food was good (served 2 times plus snack) and so was the Spanish wine they gave us. I enjoyed the complementary drinks, alcoholic or non-alcoholic. The crew were nice and polite and careful with our needs.

      "London Heathrow to Las Vegas with British Airways. Online check in and seat allocation facility 24 hours before departure are a con! I checked the available flight seats approximately 30 hours prior to check in and virtually 95% of the flight was pre-booked! Therefore, I panicked and prepaid the £70 to secure a window and middle seat as seats had not been allocated to me and wouldn't be until 24hours prior to check in. Then when I did check in approximately 23hrs and 59 minutes prior to travel I had already been allocated 2 seats, one by a window and one in the middle, so a total waste of time me paying £70. I got a refund, but only have the inconvenience of completing online forms and waiting around a month to get my money back. Then when I did get to the airport, the seats I had already paid the extra £70 for had been allocated to someone else (after I had paid for them)and they told me I had to sit in my original 2 seats that had been allocated - an utter farce! British Airways refused to acknowledge their systems were at fault and had use of my funds for almost a month yet had I been advised of my seats prior to check in I would not have paid them £70. They knowingly do this to encourage people to pre-pay for something they knowingly cannot deliver. The aircraft was dirty when we boarded as the fight was late, the toilets were blocked around 10 minutes into the flight and stank - eventually they were blocked off from use, which left 2 out of 4 toilets for the entire rear section of the plane.  The food was abysmal. Afternoon tea on a transatlantic flight used to be pleasant, with scones, cream, jam and nice selection of sandwiches. Now it is a dried up roll and dried excuse of a cake. I am never going to fly British Airways again after the way they handled my complaint - they offered no form of apology that was meaningful or relevant to what I was complaining about and disowned responsibility for the corrupt way their online booking system works.: 1 occurrences\n",

We therefore spent the 6-7 hours with coats and bags wedged between us making it very difficult to sleep or use the seat tables.

The aircraft from the stand looks impressive but soon as we boarded you could tell that the aircraft was at least 30 years old and it was so dated on the inside. My flight home was delayed - yes this does happen to every airline, but they allowed us to board the plane and there was an electrical fault, the professionalism of BA Staff was appalling.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "After several bad experiences with British Airways over the last year I used them for a short hop from Ukraine to the UK. On check-in at KBP I wasn't offered lounge access (Silver tier FF). I found a good hand baggage only deal.  The service onboard was efficient but friendly. A meal was served on this flight which was Chicken Kiev, tasty considering the price I paid. Arrived at LHR early and we arrived at a terminal airbridge and weren't bused to the terminal, as is often the case.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick to Cancun return. My first time using British Airways and it will be my last. My main issues were the dreadful cabin crew. The were rude and poorly turned out.  I was unimpressed in the standard of the cabin it was dingy and tired looking.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Milan Linate to London Heathrow on December the 6th. Flight arrived at Terminal 5 20 minutes early. Polite and smiling cabin crew. As meal option, being late afternoon we received a sandwich and small bread with raisins, with complimentary drinks. The aircraft interior in very good condition with clean new leather seats and the new lighting that was left on a blue light mood, same for the washrooms with the nice touch given to floor reproducing a parquet. The experience with the ground staff at Linate, left something to be desired as the staff members seemed quite annoyed with their job and not so helpful; once we checked our bags, they didn't give us no further information about where are located the security control nor about the gate to follow.  T5 staff very friendly and helpful. T5 was very clean but a bit too crowded. Fast and efficient baggage reclaim.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "1730 British Airways flight from Barcelona to Heathrow on 30th January, seated in 28F right at the back. Flight was chockers. We were delayed taking off by an hour due to problems with French Air Traffic Control testing a new computer system. I had onward connection to Hong Kong which was already tight, told the crew, they responded promptly, and I was met at Heathrow with a luminescent envelope which gave me priority through security (I just made the connection). Onboard the crew were upbeat and attentive, the snack was fine, some sort of chicken roll and a very good coffee and chocolate cake. I guess it was the last flight of the day, so it had that lovely end of term feel about it, everyone was relaxed despite the delay. I think people are a bit hard on BA, they're not flash but for short hops anyway they get the job done.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London City to Isle of Man on BA Cityflyer operated by Eastern Airways Saab 2000 aircraft under codeshare agreement. Checked in on line and got the boarding card sent to my BA app. When it came to boarding there were only 14 of us booked on the flight so it required some tinkering by the ground staff to enable the aircraft balance and as a result 10 of the 14 passengers got given new seats - fortunately, I got to keep 11A. Flight time was 55 mins in which I was, unexpectedly, served a full cooked breakfast. The female member of cabin crew was very efficient.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My husband and I flew to St Lucia from London Gatwick on 5th May 2016. This was the first time I've flown with British Airways and it will also be the last. Are British Airways training their staff to be as rude and obnoxious as possible? This is certainly how it seems with the awful cabin service we experienced. Our food was literally thrown at us with not a hint of a smile. The gentleman sitting next to me asked the stewardess very politely if he could have a drink, to which she replied \"if you want another drink you'll have to go up to the back of the aircraft and get it yourself as I have far too much to do to be running back and forward with drinks for you\". Strange as I thought they were there to help passengers. We thought we were just unlucky with this journey but sadly not, as the return journey was pretty much the same. Miserable, unhelpful and downright rude cabin crew. Very disappointed as I thought British Airways would have a bit more class than this.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "We flew British Airways BA2678 from Gatwick to Dubrovnik on the 26th April. Boarding the plane called in seat rows which worked well. We had booked emergency exit seats on row 12 which had plenty of leg room. Served a simple snack which was edible. The flight was late leaving Gatwick, but only a couple of minutes arriving at Dubrovnik. On leaving the plane the Captain was out saying goodbye and enjoy your holiday.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "British Airways from Manchester to Rio de Janeiro via Heathrow. Weren't invited to the lounge at MAN due to a rather arrogant check in agent. The Concord Lounge at LHR has seen better days - ordered a bacon sandwich which arrived far too promptly and was limp and rather pathetic, so left it! Champagne on boardng was warm as was the water. Nuts were pleasant. Seat area was genuinely filthy and had not been thoroughly cleaned with remnants of the toiletries bag between the seats from the last passengers. First choice of food not available, which is unacceptable in First. Then a whole row of seats just stopped working so my seat was in a permanent 20 degree incline. Staff attempted to get them working but to no avail. We ended being split up, partner on row 4, me on row 2! Nice start to our honeymoon, thanks BA. Cheese selection on the menu had changed and was offered a scrappy piece of paper to advise new selections. Staff upgrades are commonplace on BA in First and the cabin had by my reckoning, 5 paying passengers and I'd say about 4 staff upgrades (all of whom appeared after we had been pushed back from the gate). These 'mates' of crew are showered with attention throughout the flight. Personally I'd have preferred to see some of the full fare business class passengers upgraded with staff passengers thankful for a seat, but BA seem to think it's acceptable for staff to travel in First. If you're on flying on business and hoping for an upgrade, I'd say you're chances are pretty remote, unless of course you know one of the crew for that flight! A pretty poor experience all round which proves that the once 'worlds favourite airline' has become so complacent that they can't even get it right in First Class. Is it any wonder the Middle East carriers are showing the rest of the world how to do it!: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Glad I have the option to rate them a zero. Their customer service is abysmal.  Was flying home from Amsterdam with my family. Booked on premium economy, which was around $700 pp higher than economy. The night before my early morning flight I received a text saying flight was cancelled. Went to the airport. No BA employees were there. Could not get BA on the phone. Woman from another airline booked us on Delta in regular economy. Have spent since August trying to get a refund of the $700 pp extra I paid for premium economy. Finally got the refund. Was $149 pp with no explanation. Customer service people are very sorry but they can't help me. There is no higher level to take this to. I had to go on a separate form to request the breakdown to see how they calculated the refund. I expect more out of British Airways, but I will never fly them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flew British Airways from Los Angeles to Amsterdam via London Heathrow r/t in Club World. Actually prefer the B777 over the A380 which was surprising. We used the Qantas FC lounge in LAX and Galleries First at Heathrow. Both were great. Service on board all flights top notch and friendly. Food and drinks good, even if the steak was a bit on the well done side. Like that you can pre-select meals out of LHR. Wish you could do this out of LAX as well. My complaint is Club Europe legroom. I know they block out the middle seat, but at 6'2\" the legroom is tight. All in all great value for the money. We picked up three trips on BA during their Business Class sale last year. Next in FCO, and then DUB.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Our first time flying to Dominican Republic and found the best deal with British Airways and the benefit was it is a direct flight from Gatwick to Punta Cana. On the outbound flight, the plane was half empty, so it was nice and spacious. The BA Boeing 777 is an outdated plane which has been used in their fleet for many years and has not had a refurb I would say in about 10+ years - I suppose this is why the flight was so cheap. The staff on board were friendly and efficient. The seat pitch is large so I could sit for 9+ hours comfortably, the seats despite the plane being old, were comfortable and not showing signs of wear. The entertainment system is what shows the age of the plane, one of the smallest screens in the industry. They are very small, and the anti-glare screen is hard to see from you need to keep adjusting the brightness of the screen throughout the movie. The range of movies was good. Food was ok nothing special and not really a choice.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Flight got off to a good start with a reasonable dinner in the Malaysian Airlines first Class lounge. I was looking forward to my first flight on the Boeing 787 -  so much so, I switched from Singapore / LHR to KL when I discovered the 787-9 operated on this route. The new plane is very nice indeed - the so called \"new\" - New First is not. BA trumpet they have listened to customers and this revised version was to be the new pace setter. Wrong. The FAs on the route were great and dinner was adequate. The chicken satays followed by prawn and mango salad was fine. The wine was also fine. The cheap champagne nowhere near to Krug as served by other carriers in 1st Class. The usual cheap stainless steel cutlery and boring glassware and chinaware - we have to get used to. The seat is definitely more constrained than the 777 and A380 1st Class; its tighter and smaller. In bed mode - it is like sleeping on a park bench. So hard. The ridiculous \"island\" design for the table and retractable dinning table is worse than the 777 and A380. When lying on your side it digs into your back. The seat's narrow profile becomes very obvious. You have to be a gymnast to get into and out of the \"compartment\". I am 6 4\" tall and not overweight. I did not sleep hardly at all when compared with the A380 flight I took to Singapore last month. The TV screen is larger and fixed - which does not lend itself to a companion dinning with you as on the other aircraft. Its on a slight angle as well slightly facing away from the viewer. The AV remote is small and overly complicated. There is no WiFi. There is no window blinds as on the other aircraft. The windows can be dimmed to \"black\" - so you have two black orbs staring at you through the flight. BA seem clueless when it comes to a top end 1st Class. I will avoid this plane in future. A jaw dropping disappointment.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London to São Paulo Guarulhos. British Airways Boeing 747's looks very old, outdated and in need of an urgent update. I heve flown 8 times in the past 2 month always in their Boeing 747s and all of them were in the same condition. I just hope that the maintenance in the vital systems are better than inside the aircraft, as one can see in the attached pictures taken from my seat in the upper deck in my last flight. Also the entertainment system is very limited.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "My wife and I flew British Airways London Heathrow to Athens in a Boing 767. The flight was only half full. We had paid extra for exit row seats, which were ideal. There are no seat back screens and the ones on the cabin roof failed to work, this was not a problem, not a great lover of overhead screens showing stuff you probably would not select if given the choice. Left and arrived on time.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "London Heathrow to Vancouver with British Airways. Outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours. Email was received on the day of travel. It did take 2 calls to the airline to establish if one could arrive later. On the first call, there was such a poor understanding of the question that the operator thought we wanted to rebook flights. Fortunately we were cut off as I think the call might have continued for the rest of the day. Second call was more successful and a direct answer was given, no matter how unwelcome. Printing your own baggage labels was a new experience at LHR (I am not a frequent air traveller). A sign of the times perhaps but I did get the impression of going through a self checkout at a supermarket. Not much to say about bag drop off. It was neither efficient nor inefficient, just a linear series of a few tasks performed by someone doing their job. The young chap at drop off said that the delay started as 10 minutes at the beginning of the week which had turned into two hours by Friday. At the gate, I did wonder why those with priority boarding moved to a different seating area - all of 3 metres away. I suspect people need to be seen receiving value for higher ticket prices, because they will of course get there first! The flight was just about adequate. My video screen did not work and despite requests to 2 cabin crew this was not rectified - well I was ignored. Fortunate, as the film and TV choice was poor.  I do not like airline food that much. There are plenty of food outlets past security to get something decent to eat. Never really drink the wine. Beer and spirits hard to get wrong. Return flight was only made better by the jet stream reducing the flight time by an hour. Again the flight was just about adequate. Did not eat the food as I had a salad from an outlet at YVR - good value. Flight attendant said it looked better than what they were serving. The seat in front of me was broken so it reclined further than it should. The only solution provided by another attendant was to get up walk around a bit, and stand at the back. Whilst the broken seat was not the fault of the passenger in front, she did not want to be reasonable. The attendant stood there waiting for me to derive a solution.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Seattle to Tel Aviv via London with British Airways. The food was below average and the cabin staff service was average. The seats are comfortable and are OK as long as you do not have a seat where someone has to step over you or you have to step over someone else. The inflight entertainment system uses a dual prong plug in for their inflight entertainment system so I had to use their headphones which are not comfortable for long periods of time. After going outside of airport security for a long layover at LHR and coming back through the security process, BA tried to make my wife check in her carry-on bag which she has used in our travels on many airlines around the world without question - and was already accepted on our first leg from Seattle. Her bag fit in BA's measurement gage frame, but the BA desk agent did not like how I put it in. Apparently it has to not only fit, but it can only be placed in the gage with a straight up and down motion only. After complaining that her requirement was unnecessary, the desk agent relented in a huff. BA also required that I pay to chose my seats after buying a 7000 USD business class ticket. I am a Alaska MVP Gold member so I can fly BA as a partner airline and get mileage credit, but I cannot book seats without paying. Having to pay for my seat selection and the carry-on luggage screening in LHR makes it unlikely that I will fly BA again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Gatwick is not my first choice but for Naples with British Airways it is the only choice so we reluctantly booked a return Club Europe ticket for a treat. Check in fast and friendly, and fast track was amazing, we were the only people using it. The BA lounges at Gatwick have been closed and we were sent to the No 1 lounge which BA is using instead. To say it is less good is an understatement. £8 for a glass of champagne (whereas free in the old BA lounge) is just ridiculous. The atmosphere is more Weatherspoons than Fortnum and Mason and the crowd was noisy and chaotic. If what we were told is true (the lounge will be used until next year) we will be avoiding it next time and probably avoiding BA in that case. Food was small portions and service bordering on rude from the barman who explained very impolitely that they do not serve diet drinks. Once on board the crew were welcoming and friendly and the afternoon tea adequate but not exactly filling (disappointing after the rubbish we were served in the lounge). Return flight from Naples began with another abysmal lounge experience. Windowless, crowded and with very limited food and drink, again not worth the bother. Crew again were wonderful and very chatty and friendly. New layout A320 and we had booked 1 A and C. Totally unacceptable seats. No bulkhead so right up by the main boarding door. No carpet, just a rubber floor and during boarding I was constantly bashed by peoples bags and during the flight my feet were trodden on by people waiting for the toilet. Nowhere to stow my single bag because everyone else had two or more and had used all the space, had to stow mine five rows behind delaying my disembarkation. Dinner was nice. Baggage last off the belt despite being priority tagged. Had it not been for the crew on both flights I would have thought the money was wasted booking Club Europe. Lounges rubbish, possibly the worst two lounges I have been in Catering on board - Not bad and served nicely Crew - The only reason I would commend these two flights Baggage service - Disappointing. Seats- disappointing. Like the empty middle seat but front row was awful.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "An enjoyable short flight with British Airways from Heathrow to Dublin, the flight was initially delayed by an hour due to a baggage error, however this did not affect me nor the quality of the flight, the cabin was very nice, seats were nice with good leg room. Service from crew was satisfactory but could have been better, they could have smiled a little more and gave a friendlier approach like other airlines such as easyJet. The food was basic for a short 45 minute flight, wasn't expecting anything exciting anyway. I had a packet of sea salt crisps which were nice and some orange juice. The staff were happy to serve me. Overall I enjoyed the flight and will be flying with British Airways again soon: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Very good service on a packed British Airways flight from London to Mumbai. Crew were excellent. Food a wine were well matched. The business class seat is old now, but I still find it very comfortable. Video selection was a treat with a good number of independent movies. Would definitely fly them again.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "An excellent flight from Atlanta to London, with good food and drink, plenty of space and a helpful cabin crew. Plane was delayed by bad weather in London but the crew tried to turn things around. The IFE system was one of British Airways newer versions which was very good, and it's a shame it is not available across the British Airways fleet.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "Doha to London Heathrow via Bahrain. As a loyal British Airways customer for 20 years, I have noticed wide variations in the type of flight attendant service and meal/beverage service provided on longhaul flights. BA's longhaul Club World  seat is showing its age compared to the competition, but I like the seat cushion. Having to jump over someone's feet to access a window seat is not ideal. AVOD quality varies depending on the type and age of the aircraft, and storage space for small items also varies. Service onboard was good from BAH to LHR, and meal service was good, despite cost-cutting at BA being evident in recent years. The washrooms were reasonable, but not up to the standard of competitors. The flight was on time, and my bags transferred at LHR to my next flight to the USA.: 1 occurrences\n",
      "I received a message at 3am to inform me that my British Airways flight from Zurich to LCY will be delayed by 1 hour. Travelling with a 5yr old, and already staying at the Zurich Airport Radisson, I decided to arrive at the check in 2 hrs before the new departure time. Unfortunately, the incompetent staff at the check in desk informed me that the flight is Closed and no more check ins. I knew this was incorrect, and asked for the Supervisor, who knew that the flight, being at least 1 hour late departure (2.5hrs as it turned out) is not closed! We were checked in of course! BA - please train your check in staff or fire the incompetent ones. Luckily, as a very frequent flyer, I was not going to accept the nonsense of the first check in who suggested we should fly in the evening?: 1 occurrences\n",
      "BA362 6th June 2015. If this were the first flight I had taken with British Airways I would not be impressed. At check in there is a lack of professionalism. The customer does not come first even at the First Class check in. Staff interrupt each other and discuss their own business in priority to completing the check in. The flight was in fact delayed by an hour despite the information such as was provided given as \"ten minutes\". The aircraft appeared dated and not especially clean with crumbs on the seat and grease marks on the windows. The inflight shopping was made difficult as there were no inflight duty free magazines available in Club Class. Inflight entertainment system did not work. Whilst the food was good it had to be changed as the first offering was cold. Inflight crew were pleasant and efficient. Upon arrival the baggage reclaim took no account of priority passengers.: 1 occurrences\n"
